    "## Updating Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incremental Updates\n",
    "Typically the tables are large, but the updates are small\n",
    "1. Insertion of tuples (`INSERT`)\n",
    "  - Constant tuple\n",
    "  - results of queries\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "    INSERT INTO r[(a1, ..., al)]\n",
    "       VALUES (v1, ..., vk)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Deletion of tuples (`DELETE`)\n",
    "  - Delete all tuples based on the conditions\n",
    "  - To test conditional, use a `SELECT *`\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "    DELETE FROM r\n",
    "    WHERE cond\n",
    "```\n",
    "  - **Cursors**\n",
    "    - Avaliable in embedded SQL\n",
    "    - Only way to delete one out of two duplicate tuples\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Modification of tuples (`UPDATE`)\n",
    "  - Allows updating in-place\n",
    "  - Items selected based on condtionals\n",
    "  - Doesn't allow params from the `WHERE` statement, only from the relation.\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "    UPDATE table\n",
    "    set a='t'\n",
    "    WHERE a, b, c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support for Transactions\n",
    "Transactions allow for atomic operations, guaranteed that everything/nothing in the transaction will complete.\n",
    "- Transaction starts with the first access of the database, until it sees `Commit`\n",
    "- `Commit` makes the changes permanent\n",
    "- Some implementations check the constraints after every insert, instead of on commit:\n",
    "  - Pros: Makes implementation easier, less problems with concurrency\n",
    "  - Cons: Two dependant tables, Employee.eid == Department.Manager, Employee.department == Department.did\n",
    "    - Condition check would constantly fail\n",
    "- `ROLLBACK`: Revert changes made in the transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregation\n",
    "Aggregate column functions extend First-Order queries (i.e. cannot be expressed in relational calculus)\n",
    "- Find number of tuples in a relation\n",
    "- Sum values of an attribute (over the whole relation)\n",
    "- Find min/max values of an attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT x1, ..., xk, agg1, ...,aggn\n",
    "FROM Q\n",
    "GROUP BY x1,...xk\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Any column that does not appear in an aggregate function, must appear in the `GROUP BY` clause\n",
    "- For all selected columns $S$ and aggregate variables $A$, group clause must contain $S \\setminus A$"
