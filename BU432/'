# Midterm Notes

## Research Methods

## Demographics and Psychographics
- **Demographics**: Who buys
- **Psychographics**: Why they buy

### Demographics

- Characteristics other than primary family earner

#### Geodemographic Segmentation
- Can use geographic regions (country -> province -> town -> postal code) in order to segment consumers
- Can measure average income, likely family structure, more targeted profiles, spending habits

## Psychographics

  - Example: Skin cream marketed to young sociable women may actually be used the most by older women
- To position the product
  - Marketers can highlight particular features of a product that coinside with a consumer's lifestyle.
  - Example: Targeting people with social needs, frame product in ways that fulfils the social need.
