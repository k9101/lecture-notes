# Mary Case (Lecture 1)
* She doesn't seem to have any financial plan.
* Recall 5-Basic stages
  * **Establish Financial Objectives**
    * It seems like she thought about it abit with "Pay yourself first"
    * Problem: she doesn't have a goal / timeframe in mind
    * Share upper scale accomodations (but roommate has left)
    * Bought high quality finishing
    * She needs to get control of her financial situation.
  * **Gather, Process, Analyze Relavent info**
    * Assets
      * Cash on grad : $4000
      * Current Cash: $800
      * Home Furnishings: ? - hard to come up with a current value.
    * Liabilities
      * Recent Grad - probably has a student loan ($10000 - $20000)
      * Credit Cards - Don't know the balance of her card
      * Present Value of the Lease: $2250 (12-16 months) - she didn't think about the legal ramifications of the lease, all 3 should have signed it.
    * Income Statement
      * Income: $42,000 - Pre-Tax
      * Tax Rate: Assume 26% combined ta rate (16$ fed, 48% prov)
      * $31,080 after tax income - Would also need to account for EI/CPP
      * $2,590 / month 
    * Disposable Income
      * Can get another roommate: $2250 / 3 = $750
      * Can't and other roomate stays: $2250 / 2 = $1125
    * Student Loan (which she may or may not have)
      * $10000 -> $120
      * $20000 -> $240
    * Living expenses
      * $100 / week -> 400 / month
    * Disposable income: 825 - 1320
* What went wrong
  * No financial planning
    * No goals specified (need to know how much and when you need it)
    * No Cash Budgeting
    * No consideration of taxes
    * Expenditures too high (Need to prioritize)
      * Clothing
      * Furniture
      * Trips
    * No credit control
  * No consideration of risk / legal implications of apartment lease (All 3 should have signed)
  * Other Considerations
    * A financial planning would have to think beyond the scope of the problem (to avoid potential lawsuit)
    * Insurance?
      * Life
      * Disability
      * Property
      * Car (can she use the car for personal use)
    * Tax Considerations
      * Company car might be taxed
