## Life Insurance Need Analysis
* Estimates in determining income for surviving family
    * After tax income for each member
    * duration for income stream
    * Don't want to much insurance, then can't put money away in other investments. Think of life insurance as replacement of income. Avoid duplicated coverage. CPP Survivor benefits
    * a marginal tax rate, assumed inflation rate should be considered.
    * existing investment assets (typically the older you are the less you will rely on insurance)

Types of CPP survivor benefits
* Amounts for 1, 3 depend on CPP Pensionable Earnings
* Contribution period required.
* Amounts recieved are taxable and inflation adjusted, recipient pays tax.
1. Surviving Spouse
2. Orphan (only one parent must die)
3. death benefit 

* Additional Capital Needed
    * Final Expenses
        * Burial expenses
        * Probate fees - amounts that need to be paid to province to verify will. If don't have a will, province will charge fees based on the default will.
    * Discharge any debts
    * Costs of education
    * income taxes at death: typically if you own your own business at death, may own significant amounts on death. A good reason to have life insurance, even if large investment portfolio.
    * Capital intact or consumed? Should the living spouse consume the capital or keep it intact?
        * If keeping the capital intact, the living spouse may only consume the interest gained on the amount.
        * If spouse is consuming, the children will recieve the remainder when the spouse dies.

### Determining Insurance Needs
1. The Income Approach
    * The present value of the expected future income that would be earned by the insured.
    * Benchmark: 4-7x's annual income
2. The Expense Approach
    * Present value of funds needed to cover expenses of beneficiaries not covered by other income.

### Types of Life Insurance
1. Term (Temporary) Insurance: Only in place for the length of the term
2. Permenant Insurance: "Pre-funding", extends over entire life.
    * Pre-Funding: Pay in too much (with respect to real mortality risk) in the early years.
    1. Whole Life
    2. Term 100: Term insurance up to age 100
    3. Universal Life

### Life Insurance is a Contract
* Must follow valid contract law
    1. Valid offer and acceptance
        * Offeror: Individual making an application
        * Offeree: Insurance Company
    2. Legally comptent Parties
        * Of sound mind and body
        * voluntary
        * age of majority (possible for under age to enter contract: you are bound, they are not --> until reach age of majority, option to opt out)
            * The age of majority for life insurance is age 14.
        * cannot be under duress
    3. Considerations: Something must be given, something must be recieved. **Do not have to be of equal value**
        * Policyholder: You pay in
        * Insurance Company: Might not have to do anything
    4. Genuine Intention to Create Legal Relations
    5. Lawful object of the contract: Can't have a contract for illegal things (non-binding)
* Terminology
    * Aleatory Contracts: Value exchanged in the contract are not equal
    * Unilateral Contracts: Only the insurer makes any enforcable promise, policyholder can walk away at any time (company cannot)
    * Contracts of Adhesion: Take it or leave it feature, Insured must accept all terms and conditions.
        * Cannot change the contract.
        * Insurance company has complete say on the terms.
        * If there is a disagreement on the terms and it goes to court, the courts will typically side the policyholder.
    * Life Insured: The person whose life is insured
    * The Beneficiary: The person who is entitled to recieve the death benefit 
    * Policy Holder (Owner): The person who has the authority to exercise all rights in the insurance policy. The person who enters into the contract with the insurer.
        * **Who is a Person**: Cannot ensure dead people, Life Insured must be alive. Another others may be dead, corporation, etc.
        * Legal definition of Person
        * Same person cannot be all 3, i.e. cannot be beneficiary of own life insurance policy

### Beneficiary Designation
* The beneficiary designated or specified in the policy
* May be:
    * Person
    * Trust
    * Estate
    * Company
* Can typically be changed at anytime:
    * Revocable: Allows you to change whenever you want (Default)
    * irrevocable: Doesn't allow you to change.
        * Why? 
            * May recieve tax benefit if a charitable group is named a irrevocable beneficiary.
            * Divorce: Make supporting parents policy have children as irrevocable beneficiary.
* Contingent Beneficiary: Alternate beneficiaries if beneficiary dies.
    * If beneficiary is alive at the time of death of the life insured: the beneficiary would still recieve the money.
    * If beneficiary is dead at the time of death of the life insured: the contingent beneficiary would recieve.
    * If both are dead at the time of death of the life insured: The money would go to the estate.
* Why name a beneficiary?
    * Funds go directly to that party.
    * does not go through the estate --> Creditors cannot touch
    * Since it never goes into estate --> Probate cannot touch it.
* Why not name a beneficiary?
    * Beneficiary can do anything with the money. Beneficiary cannot be sued if the money isn't used as intented.
    * Completely avoid temptation
    * Creditor attachment: If beneficiary doesn't pay off creditors, can come after surviving family.
    * Bad idea to name children as beneficiary
        * Proceeds not part of the estate
        * Held in trust until child reachs 18, regardless of (deceased) parents wishes
        * Cannot control how the money is spent.
        * Child < 18 can't discharge insurer.
        * Insurer can pay $2000 to other parent, unless designated as guardian in the will.
        * Insurance company will pay amount to the courts, who will then invest the money until the child turns 18.
        * Step parent can make case to official provincial guardian, who will plead your case to the courts to try to get the money.

* Death Benefit: Amount paid out on evidence of death
* Period of Coverage: How long the policy will be in effect for.

    * Convert full-life to term policy
    * Employment sponsored plan to private-plan
* Insurability: Whether or not the insurance company is willing to insure you.
    * Average Risk: Similar to others in your age category
    * Above Average Risk: Still insurable, but more risk
    * Lower Average Risk:
    * Uninsurable: Too risky, cannot be insured **today**. Can reapply.
* Guaranteed Insurability Clause: Can get additional coverage over time. Typically part of whole life, can do so without medical.
* Suicide Clause: IF you commit suicide within 2 years of taking out an insurance policy, the beneficiaries will not be paid. 
    * Suicide changes the probability of dieing as it is not a random act.
* Misstatement of Age Clause: people lie about their age / might not know. 
    * Should have been paying different amount, subtract amount
    * Based on your actual age, how much should you actually have?
* Grace Period: Must make payments to keep the policy active over time.
    * Amount of time for you to make payment
    * Will payout full death benefit less missing payment if you die during the time period
* Reinstatement: Stop making payments, can reinstate the policy
    * Limited time, about a year from time stopped making payments.
    * Before reinstated, ask what changed. Adverse Selection: Those who require insurance are most likely to get it.
    * Need to make sure that your still insurable
    * Need to pay payments that you should have paid (previous payments + interest)
    * Suicide clause resets.
    * Incontestable period restarts.
    * Why?
        * At lot of upfront costs
        * Can avoid upfront costs if reinstate policy.
* Incontestable Clause: Check if there is some reason to contest the policy
    * If they find out that you lied, then they don't have to pay

* Joint Life / First to Die: More than 1 person
    * Payout takes place on the death of the last person
    * Commonly used by spouses: Spouse can inherit ACB of dead spouse and pay for tax later (capital gain). Have funds to cover these amounts.
* Increasing / Decreasing Term
    * Don't need as much insurance in later years, as cost of insurance increases. 
    * OR: As time goes on, take on more coverage as you can afford it.
* Double Indemnity: Payout multiple death benefits
    * Arises if cost of death is accidental. 
    * Accidental death at the scene. i.e. get in car accident, live, catch phnumonia and die at the hospital --> **would not apply**.
* Waiver of Premiums
    * IF totally disabled, don't have to make payments and the policy remains enforced.
    * Good because, if disabled propably not working, without this the policy would lapse.
