## Estate Planning
A **Plan** to ensure that the following are achieved (both before and after death):
1. your property is used and distributed according to your wishes
2. achieve the greatest possible accumulation of assets
3. achieve the highest after-tax income
* **Timely, orderly, and tax-efficient**

### Process
1. Create / Extend (insurance) the Estate
2. Preserve the Estate 
    * Don't want to loose it's value
    * Keep via insurance
    * minimize the overal tax bill.
    * Fund children's education
    * Debt management
    * Save for retirement
    * Investments: make sure that they comphensate you, with an appropriate amount of risk.
3. Dispose / Transfer of the Estate

### How to distribute Assets
1. Transfer property while living
    * Sale 
        * **Consideration**: Must get something back, otherwise it is a gift.
            * Need something in return.
        * Sale may trigger a capital gain.
        * Deemed at Fair Market Value
            * Tax authorities will assign taxes based on fair market value, not what you sold for.
    * Gift
        * No Consideration, must be for free.
        * Capital Gain: Depends on who the recipient is
            * Attribution (spouse, child)
            * See tax notes for gifting
    * Inter-Vivos Trust: Assets are transferred to trustee
        * Trustee must act soley for the beneficiaries
        * Should set up a **Trust Agreement**: can set bounds, grant abilities to trustee
            * OOtherwise law of trust applies (which may restrict)
        * Trust applies Income Tax Laws
            * Taxed at highest marginal tax bracket
            * Attribution: If spouse is a beneficiary
        * Limits on the accumulation
            * Every 21 years must realize capital gains.
        * Distributions: Subject to the trust agreement
2. Transfer property at death
    * Designated Beneficiary: 
        * Insurance Policies
        * Pension Plan Interests
        * DPSP
        * RRSPs, RRIFs
        * In most provinces, TFSA
        * **Benefits**: Amounts go directly to the beneficiary
            1. No probate fees
            2. Safe from creditors
    * Joint Property
        1. Tenancy in Common: 
            * On the death of one tenant, that share of the property passes through the estate, then to beneeficiaries.
        2. Join Tenancy (Ownership): The deseased's share of the property is directly distributed to the surviving parties.
            * Doesn't pass through the estate.
        3. Will / No-Will
            * If you have a Will, the assets are distributed "As the Will dictates"
                * the courts may reject this if the terms of the will are unreasonable.
                * May override it.
            * If you don't have a Will, you do: assets distributed "as provincial law dictates"
                * dying intestate
                * The court does a fairly exhaustive search for heirs, if they can't find any then it goes to the government.

### Terminology
* Testament: Will of document prepared under provincal legislation.
* Teesetator: Person who makes the will
* Execurot/Executrix: person responsible for carrying out the administration of the will.

### Why have a Will?
* Distribute assets according to the individual's wishes
* Avoid delays for distribution of assets
* Otherwise, assets for minor children held and distributed at their age of majority.
* Avoid duplication of estate charges
* Can undertake investments as you wish, otherwise only as prescribed under the Trustee Act.
* Allows for naming of a guardian for minor children.
* Avoids possible unfavourable Income Tax Effects.
* Common Law Relationships
    * Succession laws only apply to a spouse.
    * Need a Will to specify

### Intestacy
* Dying without a Will, or with an invalid Will.
    * Invalid (Instesity)
        * Not in valid format
        * Holographic Will must be hand written
        * lack of Mental Capacity (need understanding of what they were writing)
        * lack of Testamentary Capacity: Testator must understand
            * nature of making the Will
            * Nature of the property
            * The disposition being made.
        * **undue influence** on Testator
        * Fraud
        * Will in preperation, but not signed.
    * Ineffective (Partial Intesticy)
        * no residual clause, but some assets remaining
            * The remaining assets would go into provincial intesticy laws.
            * "Any remaining assets go to..."
        * Beneficiary is not specifically identified
            * give $200,000 to Mary... Who is Mary? Intesticy laws prepare.

* Spousal Trust
    * Everything goes to the spouse while they are alive, when they die the remainder goes to the children.

### Will Distributing Assets
1. Specific Bequests/Legacies: Bequest of an explicit and identifiable asset (my Red Firarri)
2. Demonstrative Bequests / Legacies
    * USually monetary

    * Abatement if value is less than bequest
    * Ademption if asset no longer exists
3. General Bequests / Legacies
    * Monetary amounts (specific)
4. Residual Bequests / Legacies
    * Bequests that are based on the remaining assets after all specific bequests have been fulfiled.

* Lapse
    * Intended Beneficiary has predeceased testator
    * Treatment
        * lapsed gifts revert to residual clause.
        * if no residual cluase, fit becomes a partial intestacy
        * **Gift-over-provision**: Another beneficiary.

* Exoneration
    * How should debts associated with specific asset bequests be treated.
    * If not specified, asset transfers to beneficiary, and estate responsible for debt.

* Donatio Mortis Causa: A gift made during the life of the donor which is conditional upon, and takes effect upon, death
    * It is separate and distinct from both a normal inter vivos gift, under which title passes immediately to the transferee, and from a testamentary gift, which 
    * automatic revocation of the gift occurs should the donor recoever.
