        * Exception: non-arms length
        * not recieving a direct payment from it
        * **Policy gain = CSV - ACB**
            * **This is not a capital gains**
            * If: CSV > ACB --> Policy Gain --> Taxable income. 
                * Been accumulating tax-free, need to pay this tax.
            * IF: CSV < ACB --> Nothing happens / no tax consequences.
    * ACB of Policy
        * Sum of Premiums Paid - Dividends Paid - Net Cost of Pure Insurance (NCPI)
        * NCPI = Probability of Death * Net Amount at Risk Under Policy 
        * NCPI Still based on 1969-1975

## Disability Insurance
* **Disability**: A physical or mental impairment caused by an accident/illness that removes an individuals ability to work in a field for which they are trained.
* Implications of Disability
    * Loss of income
    * increase in expenses as a result of the disability (medications, accomodations)
* **Mortality**: Risk of death. 
    * Mortality rate: deaths / 1000 / year of a given age
* **Morbidity Rate**: Risk of disability
    * Morbidity Rate: incident of disability for / 1000 / year for a give age and sex.
* Improvments in medicine have caused:
    * **Mortality Rate** has decreased
    * **Morbility Rate** has increased, more likely people will survive and become disabled, rather than dying.
* Tax Treatment
    * **Not Taxable** if premiums paid from after tax income.
    * Non-refundable tax credits related
        * CPP/QPP Contributions
        * EI Premiums
* How much Disability insurance?
    * Ideally: Same as after tax income
    * And: Additional Expenses from disability
        * This is too expensive
        * **Moral Hazard Problem**: If all expenses are covered, may not be motivated to go back to work. Not allowed to get complete coverage.
    * In reality: ~60% of pre-tax income, but there may be insurable limits.
* Causes of Disability: **Not Work Related --> Worker's Comp is for this**
    * Sickness of Disease: Must be first observed while the policy is in force.
    * Injury: Must arise while in force.
* **Total Disability**
    * Under the care of a physician
    * Doesn't mean permanent
    * Can't perform the substantial and material duties of your occupation.
* **Presumed Disability**: Arises from the loss of 2 limbs / loss of sight, hearing, taste
* **Partial Disability**
    * Unable to complete substantial and material daily duties / unable to do these in a normal timeframe.
    * **OR**: Has a loss of monthly income of at least 20%
    * is under the care and attendance of a physician.
* Definition of Disability
    * **Own occupation**: insured is considered to be disabled and benefits will be payable as long as the insured is unable to perform the major duties of their particular occupation.
        * Very expensive.
    * **Regular Occupation**: benefits are paid if cannot work at normal occupation, but benefits reduced if work elsewhere.
        * Lower claims to insurance comapny, lower cost
