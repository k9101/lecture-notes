## Retirement Planning

### Defined Benefits
* Company bears the risk
* Fund run by portfolio managers

### Defined Contribution
* Employer makes a contribution to a trust fund on your behalf.
    * Employer has no other obligations beyond this.
* You also contribute
* **Employee bears all of the risk**
    * Employer makes a menu of investments avaliable
    * Employee makes the investment choices.
* More common
    1. Defined benefits: high cost, higher risk as people live longer, more regulated
    2. Portability is easier: don't need to be a long service employee. Employee can switch jobs and keep their plan.
* Shortcomings
    * Limited investment ability: employees may not be educated. Employee bears all of the risk.
        * Employer won't provide investment advice. But they may hold seminars / courses to help educate employees.
    * Limited Investment Choices
    * Low diversification if invest in employer's firm.
        * employee may believe that their company is a good investment, without knowing about investments.
        * If the company gets in trouble, then your pension could also be in trouble. 
        * Don't want to tie everything back to your employer.
        * Funds often removed in lump sum when terminating job **if not vested**
            * If employee leaves before funds vest, they don't recieve employee's contributions.
            * Employee now has large sum of money, potentially spend it on goods instead of saving.

### Deferred Profit Sharing Plans
* A trust fund to which employer makes contrubtions on behalf of employees.
* Only employer
* tax is deferred on both contrubitons and income until funds withdrawn.
* Contributions vary with firm's profits.
* May have different classes of employees
* Contributions vest with beneficiary immediately, if participated in plan for 2 years.
* no contributions from employee
* One year lag between Money Purchase RPP and RRSP
    * contribution limit: half of money purchase RPP.
* Termination of plan
    * termination of employment
    * Age 71
    * Death
    * Employer cancellation of plan.
        * Employers only have to provide stat days and holiday pay.
    * **OPtions**: Worker decides what happens
        * Lump Sum Payment
            * If large amount of money, bad idea
            * Taxed on receipt
        * Annuity (15 years max)
            * Taxed on receipt
        * Directly transfer to RRSP, RPP, or other DPSP
            * Funds will be taxed when amount withdrawn
* Withdrawals (Not Termination)
    * Usually allowed (this is not so for RPPs)
    * Pretty much defeats the purpose of using this as a fund for retirement savings.

* Contributions:
    * Are Limited
