# Lecture 5 - October 17, 2016

## Recall

### Transition Rule
* Pre-1972 Purchases
* Lifetime Exemption

### Acquisitions at Different Prices
* Calculate the Average Cost base of units acquired.

### Personal Use Property
* $1000 minimum
* **Listed Personal Property**
  * Special case for capital losses

### Gifts/Loans & Bequests
* Different methods depending on who the gift is given to.
* Give to Spouse
  * Attribute back to you
* Minor child
  * < 18: capital gains to kid, interest income back to you
* Anybody else:
  * Tax up to where you gave the gift
  * up to adjusted cost base to you, anything above this to them.

## Bequests
* Received at the death of an individual.
* You paid nothing, what happens if you sell and have a gain?

### Cases
* Spouse
  * Trigger capital gain
  * Don't trigger capital gain, spousal rollover. Keep you're adjusted cost base (default)
* Non-Spouse
  * Trigger capital gain
  * Transfer at FMV on death of taxpayer.

* **Example: Slide 38**
  * Joe bought shares for $4000, at death worth $7000
  * Shares finally sold for $9000
  * **Joe's ACB**: $4000
  * Wife or Brother: For spouse need to elect to do this.
    * Joe covers $4000 -> $7000
    * $7000 -> $9000 : Other party
  * Wife:
    * Keeps ABC of $4000
    * Spouse responsible for gain at time of sale.

* **Which is better?**
  * Typically want to defer capital gain tax, usually makes sense to do spousial rollover.
  * **Exception**: Dead spouse has capital losses
    * Can't transfer capital losses, use capital loss then acquire at new ACB
  * **Exception**: Living spouse in a higher tax bracket than dead.
    * Need to compare both options.
    * May make sense to opt out

## Convertible Securities
* Securities that can be converted into something else.
* Convertible Bonds / Preferred
  * use ACB of Cost per share as ACB of share
* Rights, Warrants
  * **If purchased**, add ACB of Convertible to exercise price to get ACB of shares.
  * **If not purchased**, ACB = 0, so ACB shares = Exercise Price
  * Example:
    1. Bond with attached warrant. ACB = 0
    2. Eventually they may split apart with the warrant trading on the market place. ACB = COST
    1. Share with Right: ACB = 0
    2. Rights eventually split apart and start trading in the marketplace -> ACB = COST

`* What can happen after acquisition:
  1. Sell
    * From Unit: G = S-0
    * Purchase: G = S - Cost_cv
  2. Exercise (to get shares)
    * Unit: X + 0
    * Purchase: X + Cost
  3. Convertible security expires.
    * Unit: G = 0-0
    * Purchased: G = 0 - Cost_CV

## Worthless Securities
* Can capital loss be claimed if Worthless securities are still owned? (If 1 of 3 apply)
  1. Corporation has gone bankrupt
  2. Corporation is insolvent, and a winding up order has been made
  3. All must apply:
    1. Corporation is insolvent
    2. neither corporation or it's parent are carrying on business
    3. the value of shares are nil.
    4. firm likely to be dissolved and not restart business.

* **NOTE**: If you claim the capital loss and the security recovers, ACB Goes to 0, Now full capital amount.

## Superficial Losses   
* Occurs if:
  * Sale of property of capital loss, and
  * repurchased with 30 calendar days before or after the sale.
  * property still held (or have the right to buy it) at the end of 30 days after the sale.
* Applies to:
  * Investor
  * Investor's Spouse
  * Corporation controlled by investor or spouse.
* Treatment:
  * Capital loss disallowed
  * Add superficial loss to ACB of repurchased property
    * Deferral of Capital Loss
* Doesn't apply:
  * Losses resulting when leave Canada
  * Death of the taxpayer.
  * Expiration of an option.

### Example:
* Buy 100 XYZ @ $30
* Oct 1: Sell 100 XYZ @ 25
* Oct 30: Buy 100 XYZ @ 24
  * Note: only 29 calendar days, superficial loss rules apply
* Jan 31: Sell 100 XYZ @ 40
* ACB of shares = 100*$24 = $2400
* + superficial loss = $100 * 5 = $500
* Total ACB: $2900
| Sell | |
|------|-|
|Proceeds: | $4000 |
|ABC:| $2900 |
|Capital Gain:| $1,100|

## Normal Trade Settlement for Stocks and Bonds
* **T** : Transaction Day (T-Day)
* T+5 Settlement (Before June 7, 1995)
  * T-Day + 5 business days
* T+3 Settlement (After June 7, 1995)
  * Everything is electronic
  * Shorter time gives less uncertainty of ability to deliver funds / securities.
* On Settlement:
  * Buyer gives funds
  * Seller gives securities

* Matters for which year the security will settle in:
  * If you sell on Dec 31, settlement would occur until the following year. No capital gain until the next year.

## Charitable Donations of Publicly Traded Securities
* Applies to donations of ecologically sensitive properties.
* May 2006: Exempts all donations of publicly listed securities to public charities from capital gains tax.
  * This may be good for a deceased individual who wants to give to charity, want to reduce tax on estate.
  * Want to give $10000 to charity
    * Have: $10000 in cash
    * $10000 in stock


## Tax Minimization Strategies
1. **Income Deferral**: Push burden into the future.
  * If may be in a lower tax bracket in the future
  * RPP & RRSPs:
  * Capital gains deferral: Don't pay tax on gains until selling the property.
2. **Income Splitting**: Split with family
  * Have to ensure that it's done right
  * Between Spouses
    * Can do legally with spousal RRSP
  * Other family members
    * RESPs: taxed when taken out
  * Estate Freezes: Stop capital gains applicable to you immediately, attribute the rest to family members.
3. **Income Spreading**: Spread income over multiple years
  * Retirement Allowance: may be able to elect to receive over many years
4. **Tax Shelters**:
  * TFSA
  * Capital Gains: Only 50% of gain is taxable
    * Dividend tax credits for Canadian companies.
  * Labour sponsored venture capital corporations.
  * Flow through shares: Company may not be able to make use of expenses for tax purposes.
    * Pass on additional to share holders.

### Income Deferral
* RRSPs:
  * Contribution Limits: 18% of prior year's earnings
  * Further adjusted (subtract): --> Limit ability to contribute
    * prior year's pension adjustment from company pension plan
    * past service pension adjustments (PSPA).
      * Start working, new contract the gives higher pensions.
      * Now need to make up for missed deductions in the past.
  * Increases ability to contribute (Add):
    * Pension adjustment reversal (PAR)
      * Work for company, quit before employer contribution vests.
      * Pension now less, get PAR to allow for increase contribution.
    * Unused contribution room
      * Carry forward until Dec 31, until year that you turn 71.
  * Over-contribution of $2000 allowed (**not per year, in total**)

### Income Splitting

1. Maintenance Payments
  * **Recall Thibaudeau case**
2. Spousal RRSP
  * deferral/sheltering/income splitting
  * Income Splitting unique to spousal RRSP.
3. RESPs
  * Designed to support child.
  * Lifetime Limit: $50,000
    * Wouldn't want to do this as you wouldn't receive as much of the government grant.
4. Payment of Expenses:
  * High income and low income spouse.
  * High income spouse should pay household expenses.
  * Low income should invest.
5. Interest Baring Loans
6. Payment of debts & or taxes
7. Spousal Dividend swap
  * Take income from low income spouse and give it to high (can't always do this).
8. Transfer of Capital Losses:
  * Go back three years and apply to capital gains within the last three years.
  * If spouse has capital gain in the last 3 years, can transfer to spouse
  How:
    1. Dick sells shares, triggers loss
    2. Jane buys shares (within 30 days before/after) --> Superficial loss kicks in
      * Her ACB: $10K (Price Paid) + $30K (Superficial Loss)
    3. Jane sells shares after 61 day window
      * Apply Capital Loss to prior Capital Gain
9. Pensions
  * **CPP Pension Sharing (Splitting)**
    * Can split CPP benefits between partners, equal splitting of amount earned **while together**.
    * Both have to elect to do this, can opt out whenever they want.
      * If lower income spouse has a large capital gain in one year, may want to cancel.

    * Example:
    || Years Contributed | CPP Pension |
    |-|------------------|-------------|
    | Bob | 37 years | $8,500 |
    | Alice | 32 years | $5,500 |

      * Eligible for Split: (27/37) * 8500 + (27/32) * 5500 = $10843
      * Bob gets: $10843/2 + (10/37) * 8500 = $7719
      * Alice gets: $10843/2 + (5/37) * 5500 = $6281
  * **Pension Income Splitting**
    * Up to 50% of pension income which is eligible for the pension income tax credit may be transferred (Any Age).
    * May result in a pension income tax credit for the transferee (65+)
      * May get if < 65 if spouse dies.
    * Transfer and amounts must be agreed to be both spouses annually.
    * Tax withheld on income also split in same proportions.

10. Asset Swaps at Fair Market Value
  * No attribution if transfer of assets to spouse at FMV.
  * Exchange non-income producing asset for income producing asset.
  * **Goal**: Low tax bracket individual should own income producing property
  | Person | Initially | After Swap |
  |--------|-----------|------------|
  | He (Higher Tax Bracket) | Bonds | Growth Shares |
  | She | Growth Shares | Bonds |

11. Salary Payments to Spouse / Child
  * Own your own business: makes sense to hire spouse / child to do income splitting.
  * These parties have earned income, can contribute to RRSP + CPP
    * Must be an amount that is reflective of the job (i.e. can't pay kid $300,000 to wash car.)

12. Gifts to adult children / parents
  * Gifting to spouse / minor child causes problems.
  * As long as the purpose is outside of lowering your taxable income, can give to anyone else.

### RESPS: After 1998/2007 budgets
* **Subscriber**: Person who is putting money away on behalf of a child (the beneficiary).
* **Promoter**: Institution that holds (TD Canada Trust)
* **Beneficiary**: Person who will receive
* Unlimited annual contribution
* Lifetime total / child : $50,000
* No age restriction to transfer to another beneficiary (if < 21)
* If child doesn't attend post-secondary by 21 and the fund has been in effect for 10 years. Income earned (to a max of $50,000)  may be transferred directly to contributor's RRSP (need contribution room to do so).
  * Problem: Grandma sets up RESP, kid doesn't attend, she's over 71 --> can't setup an RRSP to get money out. Better for grandma to give to her kids to setup.
* Over-contribution penalties.
* No foreign content restrictions (foreign assets).
* **1998** : Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG)
  * Government will contribute directly to RESP.
  * Grant will be 20% on annual contribution to an annual limit of $500
    * Max Grant / year : min{20% * RESP contribution, $1000}
    * Max lifetime: $7,200
    * Doesn't affect total contribution
    * If child doesn't attend, must give back the grant, but not the income earned on the grant.
* **Withdrawal of funds from RESP**
  * Pay tax on earnings, not on contributions.
  * Educational Assistance Payments: Money used to support child's education (tuition, textbooks, etc.)
  * Accumulated income payments: child doesn't pursue post-secondary, want the money back.
    * Transfer to RRSP: own / spousal, assuming you have the contribution room.
    * Normal Tax + 20% Penalty Tax
      * Reduce impact:
        * Build-up contribution room in RRSP. Can carry forward until 71.
        * Can spread amounts over 2 years.
  * Might be in a position where child doesn't need the funds from RESP.
    * Can take Accumulated income payments.
* Tax-free RRSP Withdrawal for lifelong learnings
  * First time home buyers up to $50,000 --> Pay back over 15 years
  * To upgrade skills or learn new ones throughout one's working life. --> Pay back over 10 years.
    * Up to $10,000 / year can be withdrawn from RRSP for full-time study for at least 3 months.
    * Maximum withdrawals over 4 years not to exceed $20,000.

### Tax Free Savings Account
* Contributions up to $5500/year, indexed to inflation in $500 increments.
* Carry forward unused contribution room
* contributions not tax deductible
* All earnings and capital gains are tax-free
  * No dividend tax credit
  * Won't benefit from any capital losses. <-- Avoid if potential for loss.
* On Withdrawals
  * Not taxable
  * Create future contribution room (i.e. get it back the following year).
* Income and Withdrawals: no effect on clawbacks.
* Contributions allowed to spousal plan.
* Rollover to **spouse** allowed on death (keeps it's identity).
* **Qualified Investments**: Can only invest in certain things.

**Up to break next day coverred on the final exam**
