# Lecture 2 - September 19, 2016 : The Life Cycle & Financial Planning

* Solutions for all textbook problems on MLS

* Financial Planning Hierarchy
  1. **Build a supporting foundation** 
    * Take on risk only when solid foundation in place.
    * Career, Housing, Cash Reserves, Adequate Insurance
  2. **Investment in secure instruments**
    * Very safe investments at this stage
    * Long term savings deposits
    * Government Securities (Short-Term)
    * Annuities
  3. **Gradually Take Greater Risks**
    * High quality stocks and bonds
    * Income producing real estate (Commercial property that can be leased, rental property)
  4. **Avoid Risky Investments until secure at lower levels**
  * If higher levels collapse, still have the lower levels to fall back on.
* Basis of the Life Cycle
  * Income starts out low, gradually grows, at some point (probably towards retirement) income will start to decline
  * Consumption may exceed Income early in life, but grows at a slower rate and causes savings to grow.
  * Wealth accumulates over time, but decreases after retirement as people begin to draw from it.
* **The Family Life Cycle**
  * Phases
    1. **Early Career Phase**
      * ~20s-30s
      * Negative - low net worth
      * debts from credit purchases (student debt, mortgage, etc.)
      * Assets usually undiversified and illiquid
        * Home equity: largest
        * employee retirement plans (not liquid)
      * Priorities
        * Savings for liquidity
        * educational savings for children
        * First / Larger Home
        * Life & Disability insurance (very important when you have dependants)
        * Financial implications of marriage, children, day care
        * Long Time horizon (until retirement, kids go to university etc.)
        * Growing imcome stream
      * Investment Choices:
        * High-return / high risk capital gains oriented investments (instead of secure component)
        * Because of long time horizon, can afford to take risk (contradic the heirarchy approach)
    2. **Mid-Career**
        * Mid 30s - 40s
        * Net worth growing
        * Expenses Moderating
          * Kids in school / less day care
          * larger home may be needed
        * It's likely that income can exceed consumption in this stage (start saving)
        * Assets more diversified, more liquid
          * home equity has grown (mortgage paid down)
          * investment portfolio growing
          * retirement program benefits growing
          * vacation property, other assets
        * Liabilities
          * Debt reduction important
        * Fairly long time horizon until retirement (20-30 years)
        * Risk Control needed
          * Property insurance to protect assets
          * Liability insurance to protect from lawsuits
        * Investment Choises -> Moderate Risk
          * High-return/high risk capital gains balanced with some lower risk assets.
    3. **Peak-accumulation**
      * late 40s - 50s
      * Net worth substantial 
      * Income growing
      * Expenses has declined
        * chlidren may have left home
        * larger home not needed
        * less need for "things" 
        * More funds avaliable for investments / savings
      * Assets even more diversified
        * substantial home equity
        * investment portfolio growing
        * personal/private retirement program benefits growing
      * Liabilities
        * Mortgage nearly paid off
      * Fairly long horizon to retirement (10 - 25 years)
      * Some risk control needed
        * Less worry for life insurance (kids not dependants, large wealth built up). Maybe used to reduce / pay for taxes due at death, no longer to suppliment income.
        * Disibility insurance - substantial wealth built up, may be less important
        * Property / Liability Insurance - More important as wealth built up
      * Investment Choices -> Moderate risk
        * growth needed & tax minimization
    4. **Pre-retirement**
      * late 50s - 60s
      * Early retirement may be avaliable
      * Little / limited chance for retirement
        * Problem of age discrimination
      * Horizon still quite long for life expectancy - 30-40 yers
      * Parents may be dependants
      * Legal affairs should be in place
        * Wills - **Need to be thought about early on, as soon as you have any money / kids**
        * Trusts
    5. **Retirement**
      * Financial Independance / Gifting phase
      * Living Expenses
        * May need knew living arrangements
        * Probably reduced expenses
          * Health care will probably increase
          * Covered by income from and accumulated assets
            * Investments
            * Government Pensions
      * Investment Choices
        * Can't afford to take big risks (time not on your side)
      * Life expectancy horizon: 10-20 years
      * Often more assets than they can spend in their life time.
      * Risk / return attitudes may be the same.
      * Purpose of investing changes
        * No longer saving for retirement
        * Pass along the funds / donations 
  * Person / Family can be composed of multiple life stages at one time.
    * Someone who inherits $2 million, are in their early career phase and wealth-accumulation.
    * One stage usually dominates
    * Financial Planner focuses on the most relavent isses relating to that stage, unique to the individual.
