* A **discount bond** is an investment that pays no interest during it's life; therefore, the interest you receive on it is part of the final payment.
  * **Example**: Buy a discount bond for $909.09 today, receive $1000 in a year time.
    * Capital gain: $1000 - $909.09 = $90.91.
    * Rate of Return: $90.91 / $909.09 = 10%
