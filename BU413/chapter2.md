# Chapter 2 - Time Value of Money
* **Goal**: Compare monetary amounts paid or received at different times.

## Rate of Return Single Period
* A **discount bond** is an investment that pays no interest during it's life; therefore, the interest you receive on it is part of the final payment.
  * **Example**: Buy a discount bond for $909.09 today, receive $1000 in a year time.
    * Capital gain: $1000 - $909.09 = $90.91.
    * Rate of Return: $90.91 / $909.09 = 10%
    * Rate of return formula: <img src="http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=k%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BCF_1%20-%20CF_0%7D%7BCF_0%7D&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0" align="center" border="0" alt="k = \frac{CF_1 - CF_0}{CF_0}" width="118" height="46" />
      * k = rate of return
      * CF_0, CF_1 = Cash flows at the beginning and end of the year, respectively.
  * **Note**: This equation only holds for a single period with cash flows at the beginning and end of the period.

## What is a Discount Rate?
* **Discount Rate**: The interest rate or rate of return that we use to equate amounts of money paid or received in different periods.
* Discount rate is the rate of return

## Rate of Return - Multi Period
* Annual rate is almost always implied.
