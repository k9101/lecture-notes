  3. means tested

* **Equivalent to spouse**: A single parent can make one child "equivalent to spouse"
  * 1 single parent and 3 kids == 2 parents and 2 kids
* Note phase in & out amounts

  * Supplementary Unemployment benefits (i.e. not public)
  * Amounts from DPSP's (Deferred Profit Sharing Plan)
  * Net research grant

  * Info on T4A (OAS)
  * Max Monthly Benefit : $569.95
  * Subject to Clawback of $0.15/$ if **Net Income Before Adjustments (NIBA)** > $72,809.
  * **Example*
    * an OAS Pensioner has NIBA of $117,900 - how much of that pension gets clawed back
    * 12 * $563.74 = $6764 --> Would be slightly adjusted for inflation every quarter.
    * NIBA = $117900
    * - 72809
    * 45091
    * Clawback rate: 15%
    * total clawback: $6,764
    * Therefore, they made too much money and the entire pension is clawed back.
  * Calculated monthly based on estimated income -> prevents having to pay back the benefit if they earn too much.

* CPP (114)
  * Paid to contributors 60+
  * Plan is mandatory* & Contributory

    * Don't have to pay
      * less than $3,500 / year
      * Take a vow of poverty -> if they decide to get out, they would not receive the benefit (as they didn't pay in)
  * If self-employed, would have to pay in twice (as individual and employer)
  * Max monthly benefit: $1,092.50
  * Can take early / late retirement: 60 / 70
    * -/+ 0.5% / month before / after 65 (max 30%)

  * Does not apply to {C,Q}PP, OAS, Death Benefits, Retirement allowances.
  * May want to do this to even out income levels between spouses, put both into similar tax brackets.
  * Both partners must agree annually
    * Good because of variances in income each year.
    * i.e. other spouse my have a large capital gain in a particular year -> wouldn't make sense to do it.

    * Applies to dividends received from large corporations.
    * Double taxation occurs, large corporations considered changing their structure from corporations to income trusts (who don't need to pay tax on their dividends)
    * Gross up increased to 45% (<- motivation for this is there is a dividend tax credit to reduce this)
    * As of 2012+ : Gross up 38%

      * How?:
        * Person dies 3-4 months before benefit is received, interest from time of death would be counted as interest.
        * Conflict : 2 people expect the money, the courts will decide who gets the money. The insurance company will hold it in the mean time and then payout with interest. This interest is taxable.
