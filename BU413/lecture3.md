* Province of Residence?
  * Lived & worked in BC for 11 months of the year.
  * at the end of December, begin to move to Ontario.
  * At this point have technically given up residence in BC
  * Province of Residence for tax purposes would be Ontario (even though you may not be there yet).

    1. Is the natural or adopted parent of a child

## GST Credit Application

  2. Parent
  3. Spouse
* Eligibility
  1. With a spouse, only one party can claim the Credit
  2. each child under 19 is eligible
  3. means tested
    * # children : Net income below gets full amount, above - get less
* **Equivalent to spouse**: A single parent can make one child "equivalent to spouse"
  * 1 single parent and 3 kids == 2 parents and 2 kids
* Note phase in & out amounts
  * If you make too little, then your not likely to have spent enough to qualify for the supplements.
  * Phase-out Threshold: The same for all family structures and sizes
* **Example**
  * 2 parents & 2 children
  * Combined income : $26,000
  * Credit Available: $830 (2*272+2*143)
  * Effect of the Credit: $830 / 0.13 <-- GST+HST
  * $6,384.62 of their income is GST-Free

## Determine Total Income
* Include all income from:
  * Employment
  * Business
  * Pensions

* Other Employment Income (104)
  * Tips, Director's fees, royalties
  * Supplementary Unemployment benefits (i.e. not public)
  * Amounts from DPSP's (Deferred Profit Sharing Plan)
  * Net research grant
    * Suppose get $10,000 for a grant
    * In order to carry out the research, it costs $6,000 (books, data, etc.)

  * Info on T4A (OAS)
  * Max Monthly Benefit : $569.95
  * Subject to Clawback of $0.15/$ if **Net Income Before Adjustments (NIBA)** > $72,809.
  * **Example*
    * an OAS Pensioner has NIBA of $117,900 - how much of that pension gets clawed back
    * 12 * $563.74 = $6764 --> Would be slightly adjusted for inflation every quarter.
    * NIBA = $117900
    * - 72809
    * 45091
    * Clawback rate: 15%
    * total clawback: $6,764
    * Therefore, they made too much money and the entire pension is clawed back.
  * Calculated monthly based on estimated income -> prevents having to pay back the benefit if they earn too much.

* CPP (114)
  * Paid to contributors 60+
  * Plan is mandatory* & Contributory

    * Don't have to pay
      * less than $3,500 / year
      * Take a vow of poverty -> if they decide to get out, they would not receive the benefit (as they didn't pay in)
  * If self-employed, would have to pay in twice (as individual and employer)
  * Max monthly benefit: $1,092.50
  * Can take early / late retirement: 60 / 70
    * -/+ 0.5% / month before / after 65 (max 30%)
