- If a feature will be frequently used by most users, it makes sense to elevate it to it's own module (i.e. Job postings in student portal)

- Software Engineering: Prototype to build requirements

- MIS: Prototype to secure funding
  1. Show features that attract people
  2. Create the *illusion* that it actually works, make it meaningful
    - Hardcode
    - Randomness (Weather)
    - Actually do it (not an illusion)
