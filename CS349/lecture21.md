## Design Principles
What kind of devices do we want to make?
    * Useable vs. useful    
        * **Usefulness**: Meeting specific needs and supporting real tasks, real use
        * **Usability**: Effectivness in which users can achieve tasks in a particular environment.
    * Devices have become more capable and complex over time, but humans have stayed the same.

* Affordances should suggest their usage
    * Doors (push vs. pull)

* How to learn from everyday things
    * Help users build mental model (fridge, doors)
        * Guide them to the correct task.
    * Provide explicit controls for high use functions (easily accessible)
    * Appearance should suggest use.
    * Low-use functions should be lower priority than higher priority
        * Be more hidden
        * Take more steps
    * Give feedback from operations in progress
        * Needs to be responsive to actions

## Mental Models
* Mental model: How the user thinks things will work
* System model: How it actually works
* Developer Model: How the programmer believes the system should be used
* Dev --> System --> User
* Important for these models to match up (i.e. have the correct mental model)   
    * Frequently the mental model doesn't match the system model
    * Or the mental model is incomplete

## Model of Interaction
* Don Norman
What to consider to get things done:
1. The Goal
2. What is done in the world
3. the world itself
4. check to see if the goal was achieved in the world

Execution and Evaluation (check goal was completed)
* Execution Stage --> **Gulf of Execution**
    1. Intention --> Mental
    2. Plan sequence of actions --> Mental
    3. Execute planned actions --> Mental
* Evaluation Stage --> **Gulf of Evaluation**
    1. Physically percieve the state of the system
    2. Interpret that perception according to experience
    3. Evaluate the interpreted state compared to our goals

The **ultimate goal of design** is to minimize the gulf of execution and the gulf of evaluation
