# Lecture 12 - MVC
* Motivation: Separation of concerns.

## MVC In Practice
Why not just use the controller to update the view?
    * mutltiple views
    * Timing issues
    * The model may have logic that the controller doesn't know about

## Observer Design Pattern
* Allows objects to communicate without knowing each other's specific types.
