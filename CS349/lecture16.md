## [The Story of the Ribbon](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX08/UX09)
* Story of UI for Office 2007 (Ribbon UI).
* Differences in understanding between Microsoft and users
  * no one knew about new features
  * users found UI complicated --> bloated.
  * little change in UI between 1989-2003
  * UI not predictable
    * unlabelled icons
    * randomly hide/show menu items - "based on usage"
  * Office had grown beyond the scope of existing paradigms
  * **Results-Oriented Design**: present higher level features, visually
    * Opposed to **Command-Oriented**, which is more about selecting features and changing properties.

### Microsoft Design Process
* Research
  * "The Fish" - Diagram to find why people are unhappy with office, give priority.
  *  "Sense of Mastery": The user feels like their in controll of the software.
  * Collected alot of customer data, directly from customers. No interference from employees/managment
    * Which commands do people use the most?
    * how are commands used together?
    * Where do people fail?
    * Tracked user command usage.
    * Tracked user input methods (Cut, Copy, past - toolbar vs. keyboard?).
      * Used to allow for similar usage patterns between versions.

* Design Tenents
  * Goals for new Design --> How to get there?
  * Helps to make decisions

* Prototypes
  * started with paper prototypes.
  * **Conceptual Prototypes**: Explore one specific use case.
  * iterations and explorations
