## Direct Manipulation and Instrument Interaction
* Interactions given intention.

### Direct Manipulation
* Attempting to make affordances in the interface like affordances for analogous actions in the real world.
* Affordances
  * A quality of an object / environment which allows one to perform an action (a door knob is turnable)
  * Norman: affordances should suggest usage.
* Characteristics
  * There is a visible and continuous representation of the task object (what you care about in the interface (words in a word processor)) and their actions. Consequently, there is little syntax.
  * Task objects: physically manipulated, clicking and dragging.
    * Every operation is legal (can drag)
    * Rapid and incremental operations: Drawing, see it happen as you do it.
    * results immediately visible.
    * Almost all interactions are reversible (i.e. dragging to printer). Allows the user to explore without fear.
* Benefits:
  * Users feel like their working directly with the task objects rather than with an interface.
  * Video: Live code editor

## Evaluating GUIs

### Instrumental Interaction
* **Domain Objects**: Like task objects - the things of interest.
* **Interaction Instrument**: mediator between the user and domain objects
* Interaction Instruments interact with domain objects.

### WIMP
* Windows
* Icons
* Menus
* Pointers

### Instrument Activation
* When instrument is under the user's control (similar to focus).
* Temporal Activation
  * Caused by something that you have done before (i.e. rectangle creation)
  * Stays until taken control by another instrument.
  * Could be on screen / keyboard / mouse
  * Costs:
    * Have to divert the users attention to actually do that thing.
    * Takes more time.
* Spatial Activation
  * Move into an area (hover mouse over scroll bar)
  * Requires an on-screen representation.
  * Cost:
    * Takes up screen real estate (i.e. need room for scroll bars).
    * Need to physically move mouse to activate.
    
* Lightning bolt example: when dialog pops up, no longer direct manipulation.
