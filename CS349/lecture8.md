# Lecture 8 - Sept 26 - User Centered Design
* To make things usable, need to understand who use it.
  * Ask them what they need
  * ask people what probems they have with the current solution.
  * Think about the people who will use you software.
* Process
  * **User Studies**: Bring in user, provide mockups, assess
  * **Implementation**: Iterate based in feedback
  * **Usability Studies**: More users, more video, more analysis
  * Problem adds more time to development cycle.
  * No cutoff for changes.
* Principals
  * Understand user's needs
  * Design the UI first
  * Iterate
  * Use it yourself
* Scenarios: Stories of people undertaking activities with technology 
  * Pitfalls
    * Stories can't be formalized
      * Good and Bad
        * The meer fact that they can't be formalized is a strength
    * Often fail to catch "oughts"
    * Typical crowdsou the exception
  * Usually generated on demand, based on some list (between written vs. memorized)
  * List function required by senarios
    * Prioritize functions
      * Critical: Needed for MVP
      * Important: Required before shipping
      * Nice to Have
    * Group features together
      * See # of users vs. frequency of use matrix
* Two ways to distribute components
  1. Temporal
    * Flow between interfacesl 
  2. Spacial
    * Where components appear on an individual interface section
  * In slide diagram: arrows indicate temporal, boxes indicate spacial.
