# Lecture 9 -

## Last Day:
* Temporal Distribution: How a set of interfaces are organized
* Spacial Distribution: where components appear on an individual interface.

## Interface Schematics
* Includes enough detail so that someone can begin designing and implementing system logic.

* Schematic vs. Mockup
  * Schematic: Rough - more functionality
  * Mockup: Closer to final product - design focused

* User Testing - Prototyping
  * Iterative
  * **Goal**: Maximum Feedback for minimal effort

* What to Prototype:
  * Difficult, Controversial, and critical areas.

* Low-Fi Prototypes
  * Faster, easier to create
  * Allows for more iteration cycles
  * Encourage experimentation
* High-Fi Prototypes
  * Can give a false sense of completeness
  * People may think they have a finished product.
  * More accurate
