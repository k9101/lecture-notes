## Memory, Perception, & Cognition

### Ergonomics
* Physical: Users physically comfortable using the products.
* Cognitive:
  * **Attention**
  * **Memory**
    * **Short term**: Short intervals
      * Combination of attention and selection.
      * perception activates a bunch of neurons
      * attention dictates which neurons that we pay attention to.
      * **Low Capacity**
        * Amount depends on ability to cluster information.
        * measure in "item features", rather than the actual items.
      * **Volatile**
        * Can easily forget what you were trying to remember.
      * **Implications**
        * Don't rely on user's short term memories
        * Examples
          * Modes: Make it clear which mode the user is in.
          * Search results: Leave on the screen
          * Instructions: Keep on the screen while they need to be followed.
    * **Long term**: retained over longer periods
      * **Error Prone**: heavily compressed information, some features may not be recorded.
        * Because of memory/neuron overlap if one memory is stronger it may effect other memories.
      * Influenced by emotions
      * **Implications**
        * Limit the burden on long term memory.
    * Perceptions enter via sensory systems.
      * activate neurons in area of brain dedicated to each Sense
      * low level features (individual neurons are activated), combined into higher level understanding.
      * Context is important: barking Dog in dark ally vs. at home
      * Similar events active similar groups of neurons
    * **Memory Recognition**: new perceptions that trigger an existing pattern
    * **Memory Recall**: Triggering an existing pattern without the perception.
    * Memory depends on:
      * Strength of original activation
      * Frequency of activations
      * sleeps

  * **learning**
  * **reasoning**

### HCI Guidelines
* Why the same?
  * based on how brains work.

### Perception
* Our perception is biased, not a true view of the world.
* Can be primed by experience.
  * Ok button in the lower right hand corner, can assume that the button will always be there. If this changes, the user may not see it and cause mistakes.
* Bias:
  * The Past: Experience
  * The Present: Current context
  * The Future: Current Goals
    1. Influence where we look. Look for things that are relevant to the goals.
    2. Sensitizing our perceptual system to certain features. Scan area for goal. i.e. looking for a red car, red will pop out, rest will blur.

### Cognition
* How we process information.
* Ways to process information
  * Cognitive Unconscious: things that we are processing that we're not aware of at the time. Huge volume, low impact of individual
  * Cognitive Conscious: Things we're aware of. Low volume, but higher impact.
