## Touch Interfaces
### Displays
* Resistive: Pressure
* Capacitive: Conductive
* Multi-touch
* Inductive: MAgnetic
* Optical

### Input
* Indirect input: mouse / trackball
    * Move input device on one surface, see the result on another
* Direct: Unify both surfaces
    * Stylus
        * May be more precise (may let you put more into the UI)
            * Smaller point
            * "Tripod effect" : use hand to help steady
        * With Gloves
        * No screen smudges
        * Can add in additional functionality (
            * pressure
            * Additional buttons on the stylus
    * Finger
        * convenient
        * No power required
        * Hard to loose
        * May be more natural

* Touch states
    * Only two real states: Touching, not touching
        * Contact area sensing (pseudo-pressure)
            * As finger pushes harder and finger area expands, register as increased pressure.
    * Mouse: Not touching, dragging, mouse-down

### Interaction
* Traditional WIMP: Windows, icons, menus, and pointing
* See Direct Manipulation slides
* Claiming touch is natural depends on who you are talking to. Gestures may have very different meanings to different people.
    * Hard to standardize.

### Design
