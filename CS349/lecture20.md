## Cognition
* Unconscious: not aware of, can do many things
* Conscious: Aware, high power.
* **Implications for UI**
  * Make things as easy as possible for users, avoid decisions, building habits.
  * Leave their conscious brain available for high priority tasks

### Locus
* The idea about which you are actively thinking about.
* **Difference from focus**: Cannot control where **locus** goes. **Focus** can.
* **Multitasking**: Rapidly switching attention between loci.
* **Automatic Activities**: Don't have to think about these tasks.
  * Allows for true multi-processing
* Can have at most one locus of attention, everything else is an automatic activity.

* **Implications**
  * A single locus of attention causes many inputs to be filtered out.
  * Some aspects of UIs may be tuned out as well.
  * Perceptions exist briefly and decay rapidly
    * i.e. bad to have alerts that can be dismissed.
      * Low Battery: Alert and turn battery red.

* **High Cost for Context Switching**: Expensive to switch between different loci.
  * Important to manage priority of new tasks (i.e. notifications)
  * Limit intrusiveness for new tasks to give users the best experience.
  * Can do other things in the background and only show key information to give users time to context switch.

* **Absorption**
  * If people are absorbed in their task, they will be more productive.
  * Don't want to interfere with users, but if they are absorbed you can't assume that they will see a warning message.
  * **Negative Consequences**
    * Aviation Crashes: Pilots became so absorbed in changing lightbulb that they failed to notice that Autopilot disengaged.
    * Proportional to stress: When more stressed users will focus more on fewer tasks.

* **Automatic Actions**
  * Humans can't avoid creating these.
  * Practice makes Perfect: ...If you practice in a perfect way.
  * Practice makes Permanent: The way you practice, influences how you will remember. Very hard to change.
  * Very difficult to unlearn.

### "Don't make me think"

## Assignment 2.3 Sample Solution
* Separation into two packages: Model, UI
* In Entity Model, setters have package visibility in the model package.
