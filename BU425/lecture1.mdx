## Types of Analytics
Categorize by the goal, methods used, etc.

### Exploratory Analytics (Unsupervised Learning)
- unlabelled data
- try to group and cluster the data
- find patterns
- "What segments of customers do I have?"

### Descriptive Analysis
- Prep and analyze historical data
- identifies patterns
- "What is the risk of a particaular asset?"

### Explanatory analytics
- Establish causation
- "What determines the price of a house?"
  - number of bedrooms, bathrooms
  - square footage
  - location
  - try to figure out what causes that price => What happens if a renovate the bathroom?

### Predictive Analytics (Supervised Learning)
- Predict future events / unknown characteristics
- Don't care about modifications
- Machine learning
  - labelled data
- "How much will this house sell for?"

### Prescriptive Analytics
- Optimization problems
- "What is the best investment portfolio?"

## Regression Analysis

Utimately want to answer "how is Y related to X?"
- Y dependant
- $$X = x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$ - n independent variables
- Linear relationship

### Descriptive POV
Simply quantifying a relationship, describe it.

### Explanatory POV
Try to support some causal claim
- Increase housing price by 10% -> Increase in square footage

### Predictive POV
Use "quantified relationships" to predict new values of Y, given some X values.
- Forecasting
- Given some information about a house, predict it's price.

## Linear regression
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon$$

The betas are unknown and need to be estimated from the data.

### Estimation of Params
Let $$\hat{y}(x)$$ be our estimate for the true function.
To find the best estimation for the samples, optimize the squared error: $$Min_{b_0, b_1} \sum_i (\hat{y}(x_i) - y_i)^2$$

### Example

> Does doing homework influence exam grade?

- Exam grade is dependent
- Independent are number of homeworks completed
- **Note:** There could be missing information/variables that represent the true relationship (ex. hours studied, attendence)

This could produce $$EG = 22 + 1.76 * HW$$

## Multiple Linear Regression
Regression model with $$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$$ independent variables. Each indepedent variable influences the relationship in some proportion

## Assessing a Regression Model
Least squares will produce a regression line *regardless* if there is actually a linear relationship in the data.

### Model Error
- Residuals: Error between the models and the sample data.

### Coefficent of Determination
- Measures goodness of fit
- Adding independent variables **always** increases $$R^2$$
- Model error vs risidual error
$$$$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{sum of squared error}{\sum_i (y_i - mean(y)) ^ 2}
$$$$$

### Hypothesis Testing (p-value)
- Null hypothesis: $$\beta_i = 0$$
- lower p-values are better

## Assumptions
- Y is linearly related to X
- Relevant X's are used
