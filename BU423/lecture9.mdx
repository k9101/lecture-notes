## Excercise Strategies - Question 3
Short Strangle
- underlying price needs to stay close to the strike price
- betting against high volatility
- max loss: infinite. If the underlying price keeps rising
- Breakeven points: 1799-5 and 1949+5
  - Profits in between

## Option Properties

### Effects of variables on Option Price
- slide 2: First 2 columns -> European Options, Last 2 -> American
  - Both c->call, p->put

- **Current Stock Price:** $$S_0$$
  - Draw the graphs
  - notice that as the price increase, for calls: move closer to being in the money, puts: moves farther away
  - Same for american and euro
- **Strike Price**: $$K$$
  - again: draw the graphs
  - For calls: Notice that a lower strike prices increases your chances of being in the money
    - Negative correlation on price
  - For puts: Lower strike price decreases your chances of being in the money
    - positive correlation on price
  - Same for american and euro
- **Maturity**: $$T$$
  - Recall the difference between American and European options, American: can excercise at any point.
  - Euro: can't do anything until maturity
    - Therefore maturity has no effect on the price of an option
  - American: Can excercise at anypoint during the lifecycle of the option
    - Have an increased oppourtunity of observing a profitable scenario.
    - American options are higher priced
  - **American** options can never be priced less than an equivalent **European** bond
- **Volatility**: $$\sigma$$
  - Call/Put and Euro/American doesn't matter
  - probability of possible values that the underlying price could take on
  - lower volatility: (assuming a normal distribution) the expected value is much clearer, lower standard deviation, lower odds of being in the money
  - higher: higher standard deviation, potentially increasing your chances of being in the money
- **Risk Free Rate** $$r$$
  - Examine CAPM: $$E[r_i] = r + \beta(E[r_n] - r)
  - With a higher risk free rate, faster rate of appreciation, end up in the money sooner.
  - With a call (euro/american) increases price
  - With a put: decreases prices
- **Dividend Payments**: $$D$$
  - Price goes down when a dividend is payed
    - we are removing money from the company
  - Call: Negative relation
    - decreasing the value of the underlying, decreasing likelihood of being in the money
  - Puts: Positive relation

#### Replication with Options

We want to find a way to price options

Recall that pricing forwards is a linear relationship
- Via the no-arbitrage principal

With options, need additional information to determine the price
- How the stock price will evolve

##### Put-Call Parity (PCP)
A combination of options and the underlying can produce a call or put option

- combination of a short call, long underlying
- combination of call + underlying
  - short put
- long put + long call
  - long call

$$c = p + S - BK$$
- Long call = Long put + long stock - short bonds
- $$c, p$$ are today's price of Euro calls and puts
  - Strike price K, expiration T
- $$B$$: today's price of zero-coupon bond $$e^{-rT}$$
- $$S$$: Underlying price today

If this equality does not hold, there is an arbitrage oppoutunity to be exploited

###### Establishing PCP by Payoff Diagram
- Long put: Strike Price 20
- fund the purchase of a long call
- funded transaction: Not you're money
  - that's why the minimum payoff is $$0$$
- Combined effect: a long call
  - "It's not really a call"
  - a real call would have minimum payoff of 0
- To get a true call
  - Need to be worth $$-20$$ no matter the value of the underlying
  - short sell 20 zero-coupon bonds
- If this porfolio has a different value to an actual call, then there is an arbitrage oppourtunity.

###### Slide 11 Example:
- IBM Stock: $22.50 today ($$T_0$$)
- options have Strike price of $20, mature in 6 months
- put price is $0.50
- $$r = 0.05$$ per year
- $$\implies B = e^{-rT} = 0.9753$$
- no dividends
- $$c = 0.5 + 22.50 - 0.9753 * 20 = 3.49$$
- real call price: $4
- Short real, long synthetic
- Profit of $$4 - 3.49 = 0.51$$
- Columns in the table on slide 13 is comparing Stock price to the strike price

IF the call price is $3
- The we need to create a synthetic short call
- The call is underpriced: Profit is $$3.49 - 3 = 0.49$$
- short put, short stock, buy bonds
  - as always, short case is just the equation * -1

## Binomial Tree for Valuing Options
- Build a binary tree over time, outcomes of events are branches
  - each level in the tree is a period
  - Some probability of taking each branch, i.e. the world ending up in some state
- "State of the world up" vs. "State of the world down"
  - do we win or loose
- $$\mu = \sum_{i=1}^N P(state_i) * Payoff(state_i)$$
- $$\sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N P(state_i) * (Payoff(state_i) - \mu)^2$$

### Example: Euro Call Pricing

Asset A:
- Current price: $$S_0 = 100$$
- In one year
  - go upto $120 (suppose probability $$q$$)
  - go down to $90.25

Asset B:
- Dollar invested in money market account grows to $1.0513

Consider a Euro call option, $$K = 100$$, maturity in 1 year
- $$Payoff = max(S_T - 110, 0)$$
  - Upside: $$Payoff = max(120 - 110, 0) = 10$$
  - Downside: $$Payoff = 0$$

How much to pay?
- Come up with a portfolio that looks like the call options (i.e. that has the same payoff)
  - Build it using asset A and B

- Let $$\Delta$$ be the number of underlying units purchased
- Let $$b$$ be the number of units put into the money market account
- $$V(0) = \Delta * S_0 + b$$
  - Want $$(\Delta, b)$$ such that payoff at time 1 matches the call
  - upside: $$\Delta * 120 + b * 1.053 = 10$$
  - downside: $$\Delta * 90.25 + b * 1.053 = 0$$
  - $$\Delta * (120 - 90.25) = 10 - 0 \implies \Delta = 0.336$$
  - Solve for b, $$\implies b = -28.85$$

To construct the portfolio:
- Time 0: Need to buy $$\Delta$$ units of underlying, borrow $$b$$ dollars
  - $$V(0) = \Delta * 100 + b = 4.76$$
  - This price must be the same as the price of the call, otherwise there is an arbirage opportunity

Arbitrage:
- suppose a trader quotes $7 for the call
  - sell the overpriced traded call for $7
  - construct the synthetic call for $4.76 (as above)
  - immediate profit of $$7 - 4.76 = 2.24$$
- suppose the quote is $3
  - buy the call for $3
  - short the portfolio, rebuild the portfolio with reversed positions

**Euro put Example**

Payoff:
- upside: max(110 - 120, 0) = 0
- Downside: max(110 - 90.25, 0) = 19.75

$$\Delta * (90.25 - 120) = 19.75 \implies \Delta = -0.6638$$
$$\Delta * 120 + 1.053 * b = 0 \implies b = 75.78$$
