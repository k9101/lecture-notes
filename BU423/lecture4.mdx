## Technical Test
- next week
- multiple choice
- chapter 2, 3, 5
- go through the excersices (in the book and given)

Last Weeks Quiz
- answer was d: 75,648
- (15 + 10 * 0.24)exp(10% * 10/12) = 18.91 for one contract
- Multiply the price per contract by 2

## Forwarding Prices

### Futures Prices and Expected Future Spot Price
- let k be the expected return required by the investor
  - can't use the risk free directly, need to incorporate the expected return
- $$F_0 = E(S_T)e^{(r-k) * T}$$
  - $$E(S_T)$$: Expected spot price at the time of maturity
- $$k = r_f + \beta(R_M - r_f)$$

- If there is systematic risk: $$K > r_f$$
  - Future price will be higher, prices are going to converge from above.
  - comphensation related to the systematic risk
- $$K < r_f$$
  - futures prices selling at a discount
  - the asset has negative systematic risk.

Positive systematic risk: stocks
Negative systematic risk: gold

## Hedging

- Futures are typically traded to preexisting hedge risk in some line of business
- man selling sunglasses and ubrella
  - when sunny, sell sunglasses
  - when raining, sell umbrellas
  - prepared for any state of the world
  - **natural hedge**: Inverse behaviour of assets
- hedging can reduce risk in fluctuations
  - example: farm wants to lock in the price, lock into a contract to mitigate changes in price.

### Benefits of corporate hedging
1. hedging locks in a future price
  - example: farmers locking stable prices, plan production and marketing accordingly
2. hedging premits forward pricing of products
  - example: airlines hedge fuels prices
    - want to offer vacations, they know the cost of fuel, can negotiate with hotels, can offer a price knowing their margins

### Perfect Hedge

This is the optimal scenario, hard to get in practice.
- have a contract which provides you with a contract that exacly covers the loss (eliminates spot-price risk). Best case scenario.

There are requirements that effect the optimality:
- the futures contract is written on the commodity being hedged.
- the contract matures when the hedger is planning to lift the hedge
- the size and other characteristics of the futures contract fit the hedger's need.

**Imperfect / Cross-hedges** occur when these conditions are not met

### Long Hedges
- When you are going to purchase something in the future and you want to lock in the price.
- You want protection in case prices rise.
- finance the purchase with gains from the future contract.
- Suppose your in vancouver, the future is in Montreal. Instead close out the position on maturity (i.e. don't settle) and buy from the local manufacturer.

### Short Hedge
- Use when you need to sell an asset, afraid of prices going down

### Basis Risk

Dealing with imperfections

- basis: the difference between spot and futures prices
- basis = spot price of hedged asset - futures price of contract used.
- basis risk arises because of the uncertainty about the basis when the hedge is closed out.
  - suppose you can't find a future that matures when you want

- $$F_1$$: futures price at the time hedge is set up
- $$F_2$$: futures price at the asset is purchased
- $$S_2$$: asset price at the time of purchase
- $$b_2$$: basis at time of purchase
- Cost of asset $$S_2$$
- Gain/loss on futures: $$F_2 - F_1$$
- Net amount paid: $$S_2 - (F_2 - F_1) = F_1 + b_2$$
  - Note: In the case of a perfect hedge: $$b_2 = 0$$

if you don't hedge, then you pay $$S_2$$. If you hedge, you gain / loss factors in.

As the basis widens ie $$b_2$$ increases: you end up paying more for the asset.

### Choice of Contract
- choose a delivery month that is as close as possible to, but later than, the end of the life of the hedge.
- when no ftures contract on the asset, choose a contract where the future price is highly correlated
  - Bitcoin and Etherum
- $$S_2 + F_1 - F_2 = F_1 + (S_2^\* - F_2) + (S_2 - S_2^\*)$$

#### Cross Hedging - Minimum variance hedge ratio
- compute deltas on the 2 assets over time
- Bitcoin and Ethereum
- do simple regression: $$d S_t = a + h dF_t + \epsilon_t$$
  - also compute $$R^2$$, how effective is the hedging we are going to use. Want highest possible $$R^2$$
- $$\hat{h} = \hat{p} * \frac{\sigma_S}{\sigma_F}$$
  - sigmas are std deviation.
- optimal number of contracts : $$h^\* * \frac{Q_A}{Q_F}$$
- Market value of the quantity: $$\hat{h} * \frac{V_A}{V_F}$$

### Hedging using index futures
- we want to get rid of systematic risk
- one possibility, sell of the portfolio, buy back later, but high transaction fees
- number of contacts that should be shorted is: $$\beta * \frac{V_A}{V_F}$$
  - $$V_A$$ is the value of the portfolio
  - $$V_F$$ is the current value of futures: price times
- $$\beta = 0$$ as the systematic risk has been eliminated.

### Changing beta of a portfolio
- $$\beta > \beat^\*$$ short position of $$(\beta - \beta^\*)\frac{V_A}{V_F}$$
- $$\beta < \beat^\*$$ long position of $$(\beta^\* - \beta)\frac{V_A}{V_F}$$

Examples:
1. 6.82, short
2. 4.5, long

### Why Hedge Equity Returns
- you may want to exit the market, but avoid all of the transaction fees

### Stack and Roll
- roll futures contracts forward
- as maturity approaches, close position, get new futures
