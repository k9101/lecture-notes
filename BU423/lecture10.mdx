## Synthetic calls
- recall that we can synthesize a call by constructing a portfolio

## Developing the Binomial Model

### Assumptions
- no market frictions
  - no bid ask spreads
- no credit risk
  - no possibility of bankrupcy
- competitive and well-functioning markets
- no intermediate cash flows
  - no lump sum dividends
- no arbitrage oppourtunities
- no interest rate uncertainty
  - constant with continuous compounding

### Binomial Process
- S is the current stock price
- The next periods stock price is modelled by:
  - Up factor: $$U > 1$$ gives $$S_U = U * S$$
  - Down factor: $$D > 1$$ gives $$S_D = D * S$$
  - Assumption: $$U > e^{rT} . D$$
    - no arbitrage oppourtunities
- Let $$q > 0$$ denote the probability of the stock going up

#### Replicating Portfolio - Binomial Model
- Portfolio construction: purchase $$\Delta$$ units of the underlying, b units invested in money market account
  - b earns the risk free rate
- Initial value of portfolio: $$V(0) = \Delta * S + b$$
- At maturity: $$t=T$$
  - $$V_u(T) = \Delta * U * S * be^{rT} = \Delta * S_U * be^{rT} = c_u$$
  - $$V_d(T) = \Delta * D * S * be^{rT} = \Delta * S_D * be^{rT} = c_d$$

We can then derive the values for $$\Delta$$ and b:
- $$\Delta = \frac{c_u - c_d}{S_U - S_D}$$
  - Just subtract both equations
  - $$\Delta$$ becomes similar to the hedging ratio
- $$b = (c_u - \Delta * S_U) e^{-rT}$$
  - Can use either equation, just use the relevant position

#### How to find the value of the option?
- The value of the portfolio V is equal to the value of the option c at any time, $$V = \Delta * S + b = c$$
- $$b = (c_u - \Delta * S_U) e^{-rT}$$
  - $$\implies c = (c_u - \Delta * S_U)e^{-rT} + \Delta S$$
- Let $$\pi = \frac{e^{rT} - D}{U - D}$$
- Then, $$c = e^{-rT} \[\pi c_u + (1-\pi) c_d\]$$

#### Risk neutral valuation of the principal
- Interpret $$\pi$$ as probability
- As an expectation: $$E^\pi\[e^{-rT}c(T)\]$$

#### Example: Pricing a call option
- YBM's stock price is 100 today
- after one year
  - $$U=1.2 \implies S_U = 100 * 1.2 = 120$$
  - $$D=0.9025 \implies S_D = 100 * D = 90.25$$
  - $$r = 0.05 \implies e^{0.05 * 1} = 1.0513$$
- $$\pi = \frac{1.0513 - 0.9025}{1.2 - 0.9025} = 0.5002$$
- With strike price 110
  - $$c_u = max(120 - 110, 0) = 10$$
  - $$c_d = max(90.25 - 110, 0) = 0$$
  - $$e^{-0.05 * 1} \[0.5002 * 10 + (1 - 0.5002) * 0\] = 4.76$$

The expected return follows the risk-free rate if investors are risk neutral

We can add additional periods by adding intermediate layers

#### Two-Step Binomial Trees
- update state is always: $$\pi$$, down is always $$(1-\pi)$$
- Just multiply by the proper probabilty as you traverse through the tree
  - Number of nodes grows exponentially, too much work to do by hand
- Need a structure to allow for many periods, without exponential properties
  - **REcombining**: Note that `down, up` is the same as `up, down`
    - For this property we need $$U * D = 1$$
    - Then the number of nodes in each layer is linearlly proportional to the layer
      - $$l + 1$$
- Periods are always the same distance from eachother
  - $$\delta t$$ defines the length of each individual timestep
  - Total length is T
    - Sum of all periods: $$n * \delta * t$$

#### How to price option
1. Build the tree
2. Compute value of the derivative for each node in the second layer
  - Use the strike price and derivative type
  - Ex: for a put with strike price 52: $$max(52 - S_T, 0)$$
3. Work backwards computing the option values
  - Need $$\pi = \frac{e^{r * \delta * t} - D}{U - D}$$
  - $$c_u = e^{-r\delta T} \[\pi c_{uu} + (1 - \pi) c_{ud}\]$$
  - $$c_d = e^{-r\delta T} \[\pi c_{ud} + (1 - \pi) c_{dd}\]$$
4. Then find C
  - Note that $$\pi$$ doesn't change
  - $$c = e^{-r\delta T} \[\pi c_{u} + (1 - \pi) c_{d}\]$$

Then to compute: $$E^\pi \[e^{-rT} C(T)\]$$ **(for european case)**
- C(T) can take on multiple values
- sum of the probabilities, just look at path in the tree
- **For american** have to work through the iterative approach
  - Can exercise at any point in time
  - The payoff is the max of present value (keep holding), or the intrinsic value
  - This has implications for the present value of the option, because of the possibility to exercise in the future

#### How to Choose U and D?
- $$U = e^{\sigma \sqrt{dt}}$$
  - $$\sigma$$ is the volatility of the underlying stock's price
- $$D = \frac{1}{U}$$

#### Increasing the number of steps
- A smaller time step gives a better approximation of the true
