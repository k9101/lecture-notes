## Derivatives

A Derivative is a financial contract whose value is derived from an underlying security (asset).
- Cheese (underlying is milk). If the price of milk goes up, the price of cheese goes up.
- The underlying asset could be tangible or intangible.

Building Blocks
- Forwards
- Futures
- Swaps
- Options

### Futures Contract
- **Spot Operation:** Perform a transaction using the current price in the market
  - Example: Buying gold using the current price
- **Futures Contract**: Agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future, for a certain price.
  - Once it is confirmed, you can't exit (recall that it's a contract). If you don't there's legal consequences.
  - Example: Say in 6 months, have a future contract to buy an ounce of gold for $1000. Suppose in 6 months it is actually $1000. Then you can execute the contract, then immiedately make a spot operation for a profit of $500.
    - Conversely, if the price goes down, your still obligated.

### Forwards
- Difference is where you trade. You can purchase in an exchange, or from a dealer (bank, financial firm) directly. There are some different regulations involved.
  - Exchange: Future
  - Dealer: Forward

### Options
- Contracts that provide the option/right (not the obligation), to buy or sell an asset at a certani time in the future for a certain price (strike price)
  - **Call**: Acquire the right to buy
  - **Put**: Acquire the right to sell
  - This means if it's not favourable for you, you don't need to execute.
- You have to pay upfront for an option.
  - You don't need to pay upfront for Futures or Forwards.
- **European option**: Wait until maturity to execute
  - SP500
- **American Option**: Can buy at any moment before maturity.
  - typically equity based (example. buy Apple)

### Swaps
- Agreement between 2 companies to exchange cash in the future
  - Extend the concept of a future, into several times in the future, packaged as a single transaction
- Allow you to transform liabilities, from variable into something fixed
  - Helps companies to plan their future cash flows, remove the risk of variabilities

### Derivatives Trading pre and post 1970

#### Before 1970
- small market
- Futures contracts had a well-functioning market

#### After 1970
- rapid changes, technology, consolidation of exchanges

### Risks that companies face
- Exchange Risk: A company sells internationally, has to deal with multiple exchange rates
- Commodity risk: Price of ingredient / raw materials can increase / decrease

Being exposed to this risks can be bad for a company. Futures can remove variability from the future. Protects you from future regulations, fluctuations, etc.

Volatility influences the price of options.

### How are Derivatives used

#### Hedge Risks
- Farmer Example: Farmer worries that the price of corn will go down, meaning he could loose money. He builds a forward contract, with forward price of $9.95.
- The owner of the Forward takes on the risk
- The farmer acts as the **Hedger**
  - Removes output price uncertainty.
- The Trader acts as the **speculator**
  - Expects a profit (of at least 5 cents)
  - He will try to find another counter party to eventually sell to (ex. a tortilla producer), he will try to get a higher price ($10.05).
  - This is the best case scenario, as the speculator is not stuck holding on to the corn.
  - As long as there's no counter party risk (it rains, ruining the harvest, or the tortilla business changes), he reduces his risk.

#### Speculation
- Thoughts on the future direction of the market
- Never takes a single sided prespective.
- Speculators bring liquidity into a market.

#### Lock in Arbitrage Profit

#### Change the nature of a liability

#### Change the nature of a portfolio, without completely selling it off
- This helps you avoid transaction fees
- Take derivatives in to hedge risks.

### Characteristics of derivatives Trades
- **Zero Net Supply Markets**: They are only created when needed
- **Zero-sum Game**: Have a buyer and a seller, profit for one means an equal loss for another

### Managing Risk
- 1994 Basel Committee sets guidelines
- **Credit Risk**: Counter party cannot pay the loan
  - **Settlement Risk**: Possiblility that someone won't show up
- **Market/Price Risk**: Adverse movement in the market
  - Example: Buying Facebook just before Cambridge Analytica Leaks.
- **Liquidity Risk**: 2 types
  1. Risk is related to specific products or markets
    - Book value for some asset, not able to get it, have to lower the price
    - Takes a while
  2. Related to the general funding of a companies operations
    - Example: Leeman Brother's
    - You have illiquid assets, can't satify liabilities, go bankrupt
- **Operational Risk**: Someone makes a mistake
  - Example: An exchange crashes, they are responsible for the damages caused by unmade trades.
  - Hard to quantify
- **Legal Risk**: Leave things out of a legal contract, potentially opening the door to lawsuits.

## Historical Perspective
- Futures Contracts have always existed, lock in the price of a future transaction.

## Trading Places
- Obtained insider information
- Expected when the announcement became public, expected prices to jump. Start to buy.
- Other's start to buy, price goes up. Wait until the price was high enough, start to short sell.
- When the announcement came out, nothing was wrong, prices dropped.
- then short sellers can close their position, when the price is low enough.
