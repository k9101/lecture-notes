## New Data Seal (NDS)

### Chosen Plaintext Attack (continued from lecture 5)
- Find the table *k* (mapping of values between $$0, 1, \ldots, 255$$ to function values)

Foreach $$r \epsilon {0, 1}^8 do:
- Pick *u* and obtain $$F(u)$$
- For each possible byte *t*, check if $$k(r) = t$$
  - obtain the encryption $$F(T_t(u))$$
  - Check if the guess is correct (i.e. $$k(r) = t$$)

Note that the total number of chosen plaintexts is $$256 * (1 + 256) > 64000$$
- Alternatevly, the expected number of chosen plaintexts is $$256 * (1 + 128) > 32000$$, in this case randomly guess *t*'s, on average you'll need to guess half of them.
- **Excercise**: Modify the attack so that the number of chosen plaintexts is $$256 * (8 (1+1)) = 2^{12} = 4096$$. This approach check each bit of *t*.
  - Make reasonable assumptions about $$S_0, S_1$$ (substitution functions)
- **Harder Excercise**: Reduce this to 556 chosen plaintexts.

Is this feasible?
- Note that Alice and Bob probably aren't real people, think devices.
- Try to get a secret key off of someone's computer, automate the generation of ciphertexts.

## Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- Designed by IBM mid-70's
- US government and banking standard.
- Falling out of use.
- 16-round Feistel ladder.
  - Made use of subkeys, each round in the ladder uses a different key.
  - Avoids the attack of NDS.
- Designed with hardware in mind.

### Problem 1
The key size is too small (only 56-bits).

### Problem 2
The block size is too small.
- Example: Imagine encrypting a large file, on average collisions will occur after about $$2^32$$ blocks.
  - An attacker can examine the blocks and look for repeats.

### Sophisticated Attacks on DES

1. Differential Cryptanalysis
  - Not practical because of key rotation, would be able to obtain enough `(m, c)` pairs
2. Linear Cryptanalysis
  - Requires fewer `(m, c)` pairs.
  - Key rotation still a problem

## Multiple Encrpytion
- Since DES was implemented in hardware, it made it more difficult to switch away from.
- Goal was to find a way to use DES, without upgrading hardware.
- Solution: Re-Encrypt ciphertext one or more times. Hope that this increases the effective key length.
- Doesn't always result in a better ciphertext.

## Double DES
- Run DES twice, with 2 keys.
- $$k = (k_1, k_2)$$, 2 56-bit keys.
- Encryption: $$c = E_{k_2}(E_{k_1}(m))$$
- Decryption: $$m = E^{-1}_{k_1}(E^{-1}_{k_2}(c))$$

### Problem: Meet in the middle attack
$$$
c = DES_{k_2}(DES_{k_1}(m))

\implies DES^{-1}_{k_2}(c) = DES_{k_1}(m)
$$$

Given 3 PT/CT pairs, find the key:

$$$
DES^{-1}_{k_2}(c_1) = DES_{k_1}(m_1)

DES^{-1}_{k_2}(c_2) = DES_{k_1}(m_2)

DES^{-1}_{k_2}(c_3) = DES_{k_1}(m_3)
$$$

Generate a guesses $$h_2$$ for $$k_2$$, apply $$E^{-1}_{h_2}$$ to *c*, Store them in a table.
Do the same for $$k_1$$, see if there are any matching pairs. For each match, compare to the other pairs.
- If it is a match for both, then it is a match with high probability.
- If not, then it is not a match.
