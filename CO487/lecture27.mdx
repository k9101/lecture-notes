## DigiNotar
- was a CA, root CA embedded in all browsers.
- Issed hundreds of false certificates (including for `*.google.com`)
- Directed 300,000 iranian gmail users to a false site.

### Dealing with CA Breaches
- Browser developers (Apple, Google, Mozilla), want users to trust their browsers, as well as the websites they visit.
- **Extended Validation:** Root CA's must now meet stricter requirements (doing so gives you the green bar)
- **Certificate Transperancy**: CA's publish all of the certificates that they publish
  - Append only, they can't remove past certs

## Methods of Establishing Shared Secrets
- Use of RSA is decreasing
- Now being replaced with Eliptical Curve Diffie-Helmen

## Ellpitic Curve Cryptograhy (ECC)
- Public-key crypto scheme
- alternative to RSA
- Developed in 1985
- **Definition**: Let $$F = R$$ or $$F = Z_p$$ (integers modulo p $$<= p-1$$
  - If $$p = 13$$
  - $$7 + 11 = 18 = 5$$
  - $$\frac{1}{3} = 3^{-1} = 9 \implies 3*9 = 27 \equiv 1 \mod 13$$
- An **elliptic curve** E over F is defined by:
  - $$E_F = Y^2 = X^3 + aX + b$$
  - $$a, b \in F$$
  - $$4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$$
- In practical applications, we typically work with the integers mod p (it's hard to work with infinite sets!)
  - Elliptical curves over the reals give better geometric intuition.
  - Map this geometric intuition (over the reals), to algebra (over ints mod p)
- The set of **F-rational points on E**:
  - $$E(F) = \left\{(x, y) \in F x F: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \right\} \union \left\{\inf\right\}$$
  - Where $$\inf$$ is the point of **infinity**
  - $$E_Z_{13} = Y^2 = X^3 + X + 6$$
  - $$E(Z_{13}) = \left\{\inf, (2, 4), (2, 7), \ldots\right\}$$
    - Always have $$\inf$$, find the others by trial and error.
    - Example: No solution for $$x=1$$
    - Note that this is a finite set, there are only so many possible x values.
  - **Note**: Let $$E_Z_p$$
    - Then $$1 \le \mid E(Z_p) \mid \le 2p + 1$$
      - Always have the infinite point
      - At most, every x value has a solution, meaning 2 points + inf point.
      - **Hasse's Theorem**: Gives $$(\sqrt{p} - 1)^2 \le \mid E(Z_p) \mid \le (\sqrt{p} + 1)^2$$
        - Notice that when p is very large, the size of the set is $$\approx p$$
    - The size of this set is what will determine the security of the system

### Addition Rule
- Given two points $$P, Q \in E(F)$$, define a point $$P+Q \in E(F)$$

#### Chord Case
- Geometrically (in the reals): Draw a straight line through the points, the line will intersect the curve at a third point. The negation of that point is the addition.

#### Tangent Rule: Add a point to it's self
- Draw the tangent line of the point P
- Reflect the point of intersection

#### Vertical Case
- Drawing a vertical line, doesn't intersect the curve
- Define this case to $$\inf$$

#### Algebraic Definitions
Given $$E_F$$ over a general field

1. $$P + \inf = \inf + P = P \rightarrow \forall P \in E(F)$$
2. If $$P = (x, y) \in E(F)$$ and $$Q = (x, -y) \in E(F)$$, then $$P + Q = \inf$$
  - We write $$Q = -P$$
  - $$\implies P + Q = P + (-P) = P - P = \inf$$
  - Sideeffect: $$\inf = -\inf$$
3. If $$P = (x_1, y_1) \in E(F)$$ and $$Q = (x_2, y_2) \in E(F)$$
  - Chord case
  - Want $$P \neq Q$$ and $$P \neq \pmP$$
  - $$P + Q = (x_3, y_3)$$
    - $$x_3 = \lambda - x_1 - x_2$$
    - $$y_3 = \lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$$
    - $$\implies \lambda = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$
  - Note that this is always defined (not equal cases)
