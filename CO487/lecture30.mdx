## ECDH
- Scheme for key agreement

Public Params:
- A prime $$p$$
- $$E(Z_p)$$
- n (number of points)
- $$P \in E(Z_p), P \neq \inf$$

### Unauthenticated
- Alice: $$x \in \left\[1, n-1\right\]$$
  - Public: $$X = xP$$
  - Send this to Bob
  - $$K = xY$$
- Bob: $$y \in \left\[1, n-1\right\]$$
  - Public: $$Y = yP$$
  - Send this to Bob
  - $$K = yX$$
- **Problem**: This is open to an intruder in the middle attack

### Authenticated
- Each party signs the points they exchange (ex. with their RSA private key)
- The reciever verifies the point user the senders public key
- $$X$$ is signed by Alice
  - In practice this is typically only one way, you can't expect users to manage certificates.
  - So Alice would verify the point recieved by Bob.
- $$Y$$ is signed by Bob

## RSA Key Transport
- Alice select session key k, Alice encrypts k with Bob's RSA public key.
- Why use ECDH over this?
  - Google example
  - ECDH provides **forward secrecy**:
    - If an attacker obtains a ciphertext, then later gains access to Bob's private key, they can decrypt the ciphertexts
    - Uncover the session key k, get the plaintexts that were encrypted with k
    - Giving up a private key (which is in use for a fairly long period of time, +1 year), allows for the decryption of a long term of data. Getting this out would be bad.
    - Using unique RSA keys is expensive, it is easy to pick a random point on the curve.
  - Once the keys are exchanged, at the end of the session both parties should delete their points (y and x) and the shared secret K.
    - This provides forward secrecy
    - If the NSA comes to Google, demanding the private key, they don't have it, meaning any captured ciphertexts can't be decrypted.

## ECDSA: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
- Same EC public params as before

### Key generation:

Each user does the following
1. Select $$a \in \left\[1, n-1\right\]$$
2. Compute $$A = aP$$
3. a is Alice's private key, A is Alice's public key
  - Recall the security of this relies on the ECDLP

### Signature Generation

To sign a message of any length
1. Compute $$m = SHA-256(M)$$
2. Selects a random secret k (**per-message secret**), $$k \in \left\[1, n-1\right\]$$
  - **THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT**
3. Compute the corresponding point $$R = kP$$
  - You want to extract a number from this point
  - $$r = x(R) \mod{n}$$. Take the x coordinate mod n of R.
  - If $$r = 0$$ then go back to step 2
4. Compute the ECDSA signing equation: $$s = k^{-1}(m + ar) \mod{n}$$
  - Goal is to compute a number that can only be generated using the message key and the private key
  - Recall that n is prime, $$k^{-1}$$ must exist because it is non-zero.
  - If $$s = 0$$, go back to 2.
5. Alice's signature on M is $$(r, s)$$

We want $$r, s \in \left\[1, n-1\right\]$$

### Signature Verification

To verify $$(M, r, s)$$, Bob does the following:
1. Obtain an authenticate copy of Alice's public key
  - Through a CA, etc
2. Check that $$r, s \neq 0$$
  - If r was 0 then, the signature would not depend on the private key.
  - If not then **reject**
3. Compute $$m = SHA-256(M)$$
- $$s \equiv k^{-1} (m + ar) \mod{n}$$
  - Bob can't check this directly, he doesn't know k or a.
  - $$\iff k \equiv s^{-1} (m + ar) \mod{n}$$
    - This is why $$s \neq 0$$, otherwise $$s^{-1}$$ would not exist
  - $$\iff kP \equiv s^{-1}(m + ar)P$$, this is because $$x \equiv y \mod{n} \iff xP = yP$$
  - $$\iff kP \equiv s^{-1}mP + s^{-1}arP$$
  - $$\iff kP \equiv s^{-1}mP + s^{-1}rA$$
    - Bob can compute the right hand side of the equation using the information he knows.
    - Recall $$R = kP$$
  - $$\implies x(kP) \mod{n} = x(s^{-1}mP + s^{-1}rA) \mod{n}$$
  - $$\implies r = x(R) \mod{n} = x(s^{-1}mP + s^{-1}rA) \mod{n}$$
4. Compute $$u_1 = s^{-1}m \mod{n}$$ and $$u_2 = s^{-1}r \mod{n}$$
5. Compute $$V = u_1P + u_2A$$ and $$v = x(V) \mod{n}$$
6. Check that $$r = v$$
  - If so, accept
  - If not, reject

#### Notes
1. ECDSA is believed to be secure (existentially unforgable against chosen message attacks)
  - As long as the ECDLP in $$E(Z_p)$$ is hard
  - And SHA-256 is a secure hash function.
2. If p is 256-bits (as is the case with P-256), then a signature is 512-bits long
  - Recall that n is roughly p
  - In comparision, an RSA signature with a 3072-bit modulous.
3. Recall RSA signature generation is slower than ECDAS signature generation
  - Since $$H(M)^d \mod{n}$$ is with a 3072-bit d and n.
  - In contrast, in computing $$kP$$, k is a 256-bit number, as are the coordinates of $$P$$. So the arithmetic is with 256 bit numbers.
