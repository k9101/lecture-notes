## RSA
Note that to avoid collisions, make sure m is strictly less than n. Avoid mod n information loss.

### Key Generation

- Alice's Public Key: $$(, e)$$
- Alice's Private Key: $$d$$
- Encryption: $$c = m^e \text{ mod } n$$
- decryption: $$m = c^d \text{ mod } n$$
- $$n = pq$$
- $$ed = 1 \text{ mod } \phi(n)$$
  - $$1 < e$$, $$d < \phi(n)$$

### Security

1. If Eve can factor $$n$$n, then Eve can compute $$d$$ efficiently, and thus totally break RSA. So, hardness of factoring $$n$$ is *necessary* for RSA security.
2. **Fact**: Computing $$d$$ from $$(n, e)$$ is *equivalent* to factoring $$n$$.
3. The probem of finding $$e^{th}$$ root modulo $$n$$ (the "RSA problem"). Which must be hard if RSA encryption is to be secure.
4. It is **believed** that finding $$e^{th}$$ roots mod n is equivalent to factoring n. So, hardness of the RSA problem is **necessary** for security of RSA encryption.
  - Very important to note that this is a belief.
5. RSA encryption as described above is **insecure**

#### Attacks

##### Dictionary Attack
Suppose that the plaintext message, m, belongs to a small and easily predictable set of messages
- Encrypt all possible m's in the message space, when the ciphertext matches, know the plaintext.
- simply lookup ciphertexts in the table

###### Salting
This attack can be defended against by appending a random string to the start (or end) of the plaintext, before encrypting. This is called **a salt**.

##### Chosen Ciphertext Attacks
- The attacker (Eve) has a decryption oracle available
- Eve is given a challenge ciphertext which she has to decrypt
- Any ciphertext can be decrypted, except c.
- **Goal**: Learn something about the plaintext for c.
  - Other than it's length

**Attack**: Select $$x \epsilon [2, n-1]$$ with $$gcd(x, n) = 1$$
- **Note**: If $$gcd(x, n) \neq 1$$, then *stop*. You have factored n and totally broken the encryption.
- Compute $$\hat{c} = c x^\epsilon \text{ mod } n$$, where $$\epsilon \neq c$$
- Give $$\hat{c}$$ to the decryption oracle, and obtain $$\hat{m} = \hat{c}^d \text{ mod } n$$
- **Note**: That $$\hat{m} = \hat{c}^d = (cx^e)^d = c^d * x^{ed} = mx \text{ mod } n$$
- Compute $$m = \hat{m} * x^{-1} \text{ mod } n$$

###### Are these attacks feasible?
- Chinese mobile browser case study
- browsers track users, where they are, and what they are doing
- QQ browsers WUP encryption
  - Randomly generate a 128-bit AES session key $$k = i || j$
  - Encrypt k with the server's RSA public key
  - encrypt m using AES-ECB
  - send $$(c_1, c_2)$$ to the server
- Server decrypts:
  - uses it's RSA private key to decrypt $$c_1$$ to get k
  - Use k to decrypt $$c_2$$

**problem**: $$n = pq$$, n is 128-bits, meaning p and q are 64-bit, which is feasible to compute.
- The same $$k'$$ was embedded in 500-million cell phones.
- The number of possible k's is $$(899999998)^2 = 2^53$$
- ECB mode is also bad
- no authentication
