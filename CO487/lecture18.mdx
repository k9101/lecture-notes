## Public Key Crypto
- Generate a key pair $$(P_A, S_A)$$
- $$P_A$$: Public Key for Alice
- $$S_A$$: Secret key for Alice

### Encryption
- Alice encrypt's her message with $$P_B$$, Bob's public key $$c = E(P_B, m)$$
- Bob can decrypt the message: $$m = D(S_B, c)$$

### Digital Signatures
- Alice computes a signing function using her secret key
- Bob can verify the message using Alice's public key
- Signatures depend on the messages being sent
  - Not the same as a physical signature, i.e. the signature is not the same
  - Can't just cut off the signature and append to a different message
- Large application: Software updates
  - Can't use a MAC scheme, Microsoft can't share the same key with Alice and Bob
  - Instead, Microsoft broadcasts the signed software to everyone
  - Each user can verify the update using Microsoft's public key.

### Advantages over Symmetric-Ley
- No need for secret channel
- Only 1 key pair
- A signed message can be verified by anyone

### Disadvantages for symmetric-key
- Public keys are larger than symmetric key
- Public-key schemes are slower than symmetric key schemes
- **In practice**: combine both

## Hybrid Scheme
- Functionalty of public-key and speed of symmetric key

### Encryption
Alice does the following:
- Compute a signed message using her secret key
  - In practice, sign the message
  - If the hash function is collision resistent, then can't generate collisions, valid signature
- $$c_1 = E(P_B, k)$$ and $$c_2 = AES_k(m, s)$$

### Decryption
- Bob first decrypt's $$c_1$$ using his secret key
- Uses the symmetric secret key to decrypt $$c_2$$
- Bob can then verify using Alice's public key

## Algorithmic Number theory

### Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
- Every integer $$n >= 2$$ has a unique prime factorization
- Question: What is the factorization -> how to find it?
  - Can it be found **efficiently**?
  - No great algorithm to do this
- How do we efficiently veify an alleged prime factorization
  - Need to check if the given factor's are prime
  - this can be done quickly
- Given an integer, how do we efficiently decide whether n is prime or composite?
  - this can be done quickly

### Complexity Theory
- Measure efficiency in terms of the input size
- Number of bits: $$\floor{\lg{n}} + 1$$
- An algorithm is polynomial time: $$O(k^c)$$

#### GCD

##### Naive Method
- Write $$a = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \ldots p_n^{a_n}$$ (prime factorization)
- $$b = p_1^{b_1} \ldots p_n^{b_n}$$
- Note that since we don't have an efficient algorithm for prime factorization, so this is not polynomial time

##### Euclid's Method
- Find the answer without factoring everything
- Find $$gcd(1547, 560)$$
- $$\implies \frac{1547}{560} = 2*560 + 427$$
- $$\impies \frac{560}{427} = 427 + 133$$
- $$\implies \frac{427}{133} = 3*133 + 28$$
- $$\implies \frac{133}{28} = 4*28 + 21$$
- $$\implies \frac{28}{21} = 21 + 7$$
- $$\implies \frac{21}{7} = 3$$
- $$\therefore gcd = 7$$
- k-bit numbers
- At most $$2k$$ divisions, $$\therefore gcd \epsilon O(k^2)$$
  - Worst case is sequential fibbonacci numbers
  - See A4 for another gcd algorithm to analyze.

### Modulous Arithmetic
- k-bit integer $$n$$, integers $$a, b, m \epsilon \left\[0, n-1\right\]$$
- $$a mod n$$: the remainder upon deviding a by n.

#### Inverse
- $$3^{-1} mod 17 = 6$$, note that $$6 * 3 = 18 \implies 18 mod 17 = 1$$
- Can be efficiently computed using the extended euclidean algorithm

#### Exponentiation
- to compute $$a^m mod n$$ first compute $$d = a^m$$, then $$d mod n$$
  - This is not polynomial time, $$O(2^k * k)$$
- Want: $$17^{73} mod n$$
  - Write $$73 = 64 + 8 + 1$$
  - $$\implies 17^{73} = 17^{64} + 17^{8} + 17$$
  - Then repeatly compute $$17^2 mod n$$
  - Note: Never increases to more than $$2k$$ bits
