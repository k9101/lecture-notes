## PEAS
- Performance Measure
- Environment
- Actuators
- Sensors

## Properties of the task environment

### Fully Observable
- We know everything about the environment

### Partially
- We may be missing info

### Deterministic
- The outcome of the actions are certain

### Stochastic
- Some amount of randomness between outcomes

### Episodic
- Short independant

### Sequential
- Long sequence that depends on eachother

### Static
- Environment doesn't chagnge, unless the agent does something

### Dynamic
- Environment can change on it's own

### Discrete vs. continuous
- The types of variables needed (type of math)

### Single agent vs. multiagent
- One agent: You're the only one, don't have to consider other actors
- Multiagent: Agents have to consider other agents
