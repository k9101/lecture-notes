## Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit

### Buffer Overflow Attacks
- Corrupt the execution stack by writing past the end of some buffer. Thereby, corrupting later parts of the stack in potentially harmful ways.
- Example: Jump to a different return address then expected.

A buffer is a contiguous allocation of memory. Dynamic buffers are typically allocated on the stack at run-time.

### Process Memory Organization

Recall the 3 parts of a program:
1. Text
  - Includes the instructions (code) and any read-only data.
2. Data
  - Initialized and uninitialized
  - static variables
3. Stack

#### Recall: Stacks
- Designed with functions / Procedure calls in mind
- Dynamically allocate local variables of a function onto the stack
- Used when calling a function to pass parameters to a new function, recieve a return value from a function, and contains the return address at the base
- Stack Pointer (SP): Points to the top of the stack, points to the last address of the stack.
  - The Lowest numerical address of the stack
- Frame Pointer (FP): Points to a fixed location within a stack frame.
- The stack typically grows down, towards lower memory addresses.
- Local variables can be referenced by offsets from SP or FP
  - Local variables have negative offsets from FP
  - Function Parameters have positive offsets from FP
