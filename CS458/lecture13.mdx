## Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Detect if attacks are happening on the network
- second line of defence, in case firewall fails
- monitor various parts of the network
  - ports
  - traffic
- store and analyze these events
1. Host based vs. Network based
2. Signature based vs. Heuristic/Anomaly based
  - signature: each known attack has a signature. Polymorphic worms are an issue
  - Heuristic: look for anomalous behaviour, can help with Polymorphic. False positives and Negatives are an issue.
    - machine learning

### Example: Tripwire
- Anomaly, host--based IDS
- detect changes to system files
- hash system files, store on read-only CD
- Periodically compare the files to the CD
  - use a second machine to do this.
  - If the system itself is compromised, we can't trust the information coming from it
- may need to recompute in the case of upgrade, valid changes, etc

### Stealth Mode
- wiretapping, reading traffic
- another interface to respond to alarms

### Respond to alarms
- the actual response depends on the impact of attack
- write log to alert a person

### False Positives / False Negatives
- FP: Flag a benign event as an attack
  - might lead to true positives being ignored
  - cry wolf
- FN: Let an attack slip through

IDs needs to be monitored to tune params, find a balance

## Module 5: Internet Security and Privacy

### Crytography
- send secret messages over a public channel
- write the message in such a way so that the message can only be read by authorized parties
- plaintext -> ciphertext
- **cryptanalysis**: Break secret messages

#### Terms
- Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave: Innocent people
- Eve: Passive adversary
- Mallory: Man-in-the-middle
- Trent: Trusted Third Party

#### Building blocks
- **confidentiality**: Prevent Eve from reading Alice's messages
- **integrity**: Prevent Mallory from changing Alice's messages, without detection
- **authenticity**: prevent Mallory from impersonating Alice

#### Kerckhoff' Principal

The security of a cryptosystem should not rely on a secret that's hard (or expensive) to change.

Why not?
- If someone learns the secrets of your system, you have to design a new system
- If you can't tell anyone about the system's details, only the designer can validate
  - when the system is open, many people can be analyzed

Instead have an open system, with parameters dictating the secrets (ex. keys)

implications
- System security is bounded from above by the number of secret keys

#### crypto scheme
- Encryption algorithm: $$E_k$$
- decryption algorithm: $$D_k$$
- Key generation algorithm: Generates k.

### Secret/symmetric Key Encryption

Alice and Bob use the same key the encrypt and decrypt the messages.

#### Perfect Secret Key: One-Time Pad
- given a message of bit-length N, generate a random N-bit string, XOR
- $$C = T \oplus Pad$$
- Very important that the pad is only used once
  - $$C_1 \oplus C_2 = T_1 \oplus T_2$$ - which doesn't depend on the secret key

The key needs to be communicated over some secure channel, but note that the key length is the same as the plaintext length.
- Secure channels tend to be slower that open channels

If we don't have the key, then it is equally likely that a given message could be using a given key.
- You have no information on which one it was
- $$2^N$$ possible keys

### Computational Security

Use the hardness of the problem to provide security. You're adversary doesn't have enough resources to solve the problem.
- Large key sizes

Worst case is exhaustive key search
- Should be difficult enough such that this isn't feasible in a reasonable amount of time.

#### US Crypto Export limits
- DES Encryption developed by US government
- Use inside states: 56-bit
- internationally: 40-bit (since the government could break it)

Moore's law becomes an issue. If you wait long enough, computers will be fast enough such that exhaustive key search is feasible.
- Another issue is Grover's Search: Can perform exhaustive key search in $$O(2^\sqrt{n})$$
- But realistically, this isn't a huge issue.

### Stream Cipher
- Have some secret key, given to a keystream generator
  - If you use the secret key twice, then the keystream generator will generate the same stream.
  - same scenario as One-time pad
- Generate a key that is the same length as the plaintext, XOR
- Only pseudorandom
- RC4 is an example

Pros
- Very fast
  - good to send lots of data

cons
- hard to use correctly

How to use the same key multiple times?
- Add a salt or pepper

### Block Ciphers
- Key of size N
- Divide the plaintext into blocks of size N
- Operate on one block at a time
- AES

If the messages isn't a multiple of the block size: pad the message

Different modes of operation dictate how the algorithm operates on multiple blocks
- ECB: Electronic Cook Book Mode
  - Just encrypt each block individually
  - pointless, exposes patterns in the plaintext. Same blocks result in the same ciphertext
- CBC: Cipher Block Chaining
  - Have some $$C_0 = IV$$
  - Blocks feed into eachother
  - C_i = E_k(P_i) \oplus C_{i-1}$$_
- GCM: Galois Counter Mode
  - Define a nonce
  - increment the counter for each block
