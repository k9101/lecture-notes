# Lecture 9 - May 30, 2018

## Trusted OS Design
- fundamental: access control between subjects and objects
  - subjects: users
  - object: files, media
- Make security part of the design process from the beginning

### Least Privilege
- Give the lowest access possible
- limits the possibility for damage

### Economy of mechanism
- simple, minimal, straightforward
- easy to understand, test

### Open Design
- no **security by obscurity**: hiding something doesn't mean it's secret
  - Might just mean a bit more work for an attacker
- secrets should be keys

### Complete Mediation
- check every access
- make sure the user still has the permissions

### Permission Based / Fail-safe defaults
- defaults should be denial
- whitelists vs. blacklists
  - whitelists minimize the scope of access

### Separation of Privileges
- 2+ conditions met to gain access
- 2FA
- Cashier needs manager to approve large transactions

### Least Common Mechanisms
- Every shared mechanism could be used as a covert channel
- libraries, files

### Ease of Use
- If protection is hard to use, no one will use it.
- Bad example: Windows Vista, annoying permission system, no one used it

## Security Features of a Trusted OS

### Access Control
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
  - Central authority establishes who can access what
  - implement: Chinese Wall, Bell-la Padula, Biba
  - military, very inflexible
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
  - owners of an object have some control
  - grant others access
  - Unix or Windows
  - good for organizations (workplaces)
- Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - last lecture

- Use combinations: follow strictest first (MAC -> DAC)

### Object Reuse protection
- Alice allocates a buffer to store her password, the process frees it, another process could come along and later read.
  - Spectre, information leaked in registers.
- **Defensive Programming:** Don't rely on the OS, clear the region yourself.

### Hidden Data
- Soft deletion of data
- You think you deleted some data, but it still exists somewhere, allowing it to be reused.

### Complete Mediation / Trusted Paths
- Complete Mediation: Ensure that all accesses are checked, proper permissions
  - If data has multiple access paths and one isn't checked, then possible to bypass
  - Only as strong as the weakest link
- Trusted Paths: Tricking users into trusted scenarios
  - fake OS login screens. `CTRL+ALT+DELETE`
  - enter `sudo` into an untrusted application

### Accountability and Audit
- keep of log of all security events
- if something bad happens, events can be replayed to understand what went wrong.
  - hold others accountable
- How Granular?
  - find-grain logs: space / performance issues. Few malicious attempts compared to legit. Harder to analyze.
  - Coarse-grained: You could be missing information that could assist the analysis.

### Intrusion Detection
- OS can detect abnormal / potentially malicous patterns of behaviour.
  - anomalies
- Alert the user / try to mitigate.
- False positive / negatives are an issue
  - false positives could wrongly alert the user to benign programs

### Trusted Computing Base (TCB)
- Part of a Trusted OS that enforces the OS's security policy
- Possible implementations
  1. Kernelized Design
    - monolithic, TCB is distributed throughout the kernel
  2. Isolation
    - separate small module to handle these operations
    - easier to test
  3. Ring-like structure
    - Security kernel enforces for the OS
    - Sits infront of the hardware

#### Rings
- different "layers" of security
- If process runs in ring n, can access higher rings
- Attempts to access lower rings will cause the security policy to be consulted.

#### Reference Monitor

--------
subjects -> access_request
access_request -> monitor
monitor -> objects
monitor -> policy
policy -> monitor
subjects -> authentication
-------

- tamperproof, unbypassible
- should be simple

### Virtualization
- logical isolation / separation of processes
- Virtual memory: processes believe they own all of the memory
  - Page mapping
- Virtual machine: Belief that it has access to all of the hardware / IO
  - attacks could be limited to the virtual environment (sandboxing)
  - A rootkit is wrap your OS in a virtual environment

### Application Insulation
- Memory encryption applcation shielding from other apps
- trusted and untrusted applications / code
- untrusted code talks to trusted code via an API
- store data in a secure enclave.
- If the memory leaks to another process, it would be basically useless.
- How it compares with virtualization
  - virtualization the OS / other applications could still have access

### Least Privilege Examples
- Windows NT: any process has full access
- pre-Vista: fine-grain access, but users always just ran as administer
- Vista: temporary access control
  - integrity levels (lower for downloaded files, web browsers)
- SELinux, AppArmor
  - difficult to set up
  - lots of things to specify
- iPhone
  - Original: run all Apps as root, but no third part apps
  - Post-App Store: run all apps in a sandbox
- Chroot
  - sandbox a command by changing its root directory, can't access files outside of that folder
  - libraries need to be in that directory
  - problem if you can break out of the sandbox
  - Trick processes into using a spoofed `/etc/passwd` file

#### Compartmentalization
- Divide application into different parts
- some compartments may have different priviliges, run in a sandbox
- parts that deal with untrusted data, run in sandboxed process
- child needs to contact the monitor to get access to certain data
  - monitor could reject / terminate the child

### setuid/suid bit
- read/write/exec bits, and suid bit
- If suid bit is set for executable, the program will run with the prividges of the owner, not the caller
  - Problem if owned by root, if Alice runs could cause damage to real files.

### Assurance

We want other people to trust the security of our OS, convince them via:

- testing
  - demonstrate existence of problems, not absence
  - can't check all possible cases (in most cases)
  - pen testing: ask outside experts to break in.
- formal verification
  - logic proofs
- validation
  - traditional software engineering methods
  - requirements, code reviews, etc.

### Evaluation
- trusted entity evaluate the OS, give rating if it satisfies some criteria
- criteria
  - protection profiles: security threats and objectives
  - rate on the profiles
