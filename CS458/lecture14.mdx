## Public Key Encryption

### Key Exchange

Alice and Bob need to exchange a secret key in order communicate.

Use public key crypto to share a shared secret (session key), then use a symettric scheme (AES)
- RSA requires large keys (2048+ bit) to be secure, slow, expensive.
- AES 128-ish bit keys are sufficient, much faster
- **Hybrid Cryptography**

### Properties of secure hash functions
- Preimage resistance: Given H(x), infeasible to find x
- Second Preimage resistance: Given $$(x, H(x))$$, infeasible to find x' s.t $$H(x) = H(x')$$ and $$x \neq x'$$
- Collision resistant: It is infeasible to find $$x, x'$$ st. $$H(x) = H(x')$$ and $$x \neq x'$$
