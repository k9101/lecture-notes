## Chapter 1 - Introduction

### Scope of marketing Activities
1. Strategic
  - Proactive decisions to increase company's position in the marketplace
  - Which markets?
  - Which segments?
  - What value do we offer our target customers?
2. Functional
  - Marketing as a functional area of responsibility
  - Decisions regarding price, product, place, and promotion (**4 P's**)
  - Cross-functional interactions
3. Tactical
  - development and implementation of marketing tools

**Moment of Truth**
- every interaction with a customer can either strengthen or undermine the relationship

**High Tech**
- Shifts over time
- cutting edge technology at the current time

Motivation for classification of high tech
1. technology play a large role in the economy
2. The need to modify standard marketing strategies for high tech products

### Clarifying the Domain of High Tech
1. Government-Based Classifications
  - Desire to classify and measure economic activity
  - **Input-Based Definitions**:
    - number of technical employees
    - Amount of R&D outlays
    - Number of patents filed in a given industry
    | Pro | Con |
    |----|-----|
    | Easy to obtain data | arbitrary threshholds |
    | classification is objective | classifications may include industries not thought of as high tech |
    | Correlation is reasonably high for level 1 industries | Classifications may omit very new industries |
    | Data on high tech service sector is included | Different input based measures will result in different classifications |

  - **Output-Based Definitions**:
    - outputs (products) embody new / leading technologies
    - determined by a panel of experts
    | Pro | Con |
    |----|------|
    | Classification tends to have face value | judgements are subjective |
    | Good correlation for level 1 industries | not as comprehensive as input based |
    | | Low correlation for level 2 and 3 industries |

2. Classifications based on shared industry characteristics
3. Various types of innovations

### Common Characteristics of High Tech Environments

1. Market Uncertainty
  - What needs will the technology meet?
  - How will they change in the future?
  - Will the market adopt industry standards
  - How fast will the innovation spread?
  - How large is the potential market?
2. Technological Uncertainty
  - Will the technology work as expected?
  - Will the delivery timeline be met?
  - Will the vendor deliever a high quality service
  - Will there be side effects of the new product or service?
  - Will new technology make ours obsolete?
3. Competitive Volitity
  - Who are our competitors?
  - how will they compete?
  - What are their product offerings?

**The Chasm**
Need to transition between two market segments:
- **Visionaries**: Quick to appreciate new developments
- **Pragmatics**: need more hand holding
  - The majority of the market

**Convergance**: Technologies that begin to offer the same functionality

**Marketing Myopia**
Refers the tendancy of manager to be narrow minded / shortsighted

1. Our technology is so new that we will have no competitors
2. The new technology being commercialized by new competitors will not pose a large threat
3. That competitor is in a different industry, and it's strategies don't/won't effect my business

**Innovator's Dilemma**: The difficulty that market leaders have in developing distruptive technologies
  - This occurs because they are invested in current technology
  - Must please shareholders who use this technology

**Creative Destruction**: New technologies can make old technologies obsolete
  - Creating new leaders in the market

**Types of Innovations**
1. Increamental verses breakthrough
  - Incremental: Continuations of existing products
  - Breakthrough: Totally new that involve considerable change in technologies and methods
2. Product vs. process
  - Product: New products that offer improvements in functional characteristics (technical abilities, ease of use)
  - Process: New tecniques in producing goods and services
    - Improving effectivness / efficiency of production processes
3. architectural vs. component
  - Architectural
    - Platform
    - New foundation for how components of a system work together
  - Component: New parts / materials within the same platform
4. sustaining vs. distruptive
  - Sustaining: New products that target demanding, high-end customers with improved performance
  - Distruptive: New products or services that are simpler, more convenient, less sophisticated, and/or less expensive than existing products; typically appeal to customers at the lower end of the market
    - Attracts low end initially, then moves up market
    - **New Market Disruption**: Converts previous non-customers into new customers
5. organizational
  - Create or Alter business structures
  - **Business strategy innovations**: Changes in the way business is done in terms of capturing value; may include new methods of financial management, or innovations aimed at social needs and issues.
  - **Marketing innovations**: Changes in the way marketing is done, for example, the use of the Internet for advertising purposes, improvements in product design or packaging, product promotion, pricing, service strategies, supply chain strategies, and so forth.
