## The new Digital Landscape

### Blockbuster Strategy
- Due to limited shelf space
- Put the majority of resources into few products (most likely best sellers)
- Expectation that the big hits will make up for any losses

But know there's infinite shelf space (i.e. the internet), giving consumers many more options to consider.

### Is Blockbuster strategy still effective?

**Different Viewpoints**:
- **YES**
  - Lesser talent is a poor substitute for greater talent. Tiny advantages can be massively rewarded.
    - Popular products may become disproportionally more popular than their competition, making consumers even more likely to purchase it because of it's popularity.
    - Why would anyone settle for the second best, all else equal?
  - People are inherently social, like to use the same things that their friends and families use.
  - When the cost of production / duplication is low (for online, $0), the cost advantages of a blockbuster seller is huge.
- **NO - The Long Tail Theory**
  - Now that consumers can find products that are more closely tailored to their individual needs. They are likely to drift away from homogenous production.
  - Companies should shift their focus from block busters to niche offerings that cannot be profitably provided via brick and mortar.

## Lecture

### Project Outline
- What industries will it impact?
- Why is it distruptive?

### Types of Disruption
1. Disintermediation
  - Get rid of the middlemand. Earn revenues for supplier and customer (via transaction fees, shipping, etc.)
2. Digitization
  - Take a physical product, put it online
3. Ingenuity
  - Solving a problem that already exists
  - Think of a clever way to do something

### What about the Disrupted?
- What should they do?
- **VERY IMPORTANT FOR EXAM**
