## Simpler Neural Models
In a HH model, you need to solve a 4-D system. Instead, we can use 1 variable. Don't need to model the spike itself, just when it happens.

### Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) Model
- Simply records when the spike occurs (i.e. when the voltage reaches the threashold)

Let $$g_L = \frac{1}{R}$$
$$$
c \frac{dv}{dt} = J_{in} - g_L(v - v_L) \\
\implies Rc \frac{dv}{dt} = RJ_{in} - Rg_L(v - v_L) \\
\implies \tau_m \frac{dv}{dt} = V_{in} - (V - V_L) \{ V < V_{in} \} \text{ (Ohm's Law)}\\
\\
v = \frac{V - V_L}{V_{in} - V_{L}} \implies v < 1 \\
\implies \tau_m \frac{dv}{dt} = v_in - v ; v < 1
$$$

**Eurler's Method for assignment 1**

If $$v_{in} > 1$$ the LIF neuron will spike.

$$$
t_{isi} = \tau_{ref} + t^*; v(t^*) = 1 \\
\implies v(t^*) = 1 = v_{in}(1 - e^\frac{-t^*}{t}) \\
\implies 1 - e^\frac{-t^*}{t} = \frac{1}{v_{in}} \\
\implies e^\frac{-t^*}{t} = 1 - \frac{1}{v_{in}} \\
\implies t^* = -t \ln{1 - \frac{1}{v_{in}}} \\
\therefore t_{isi} = t_{ref} - t\ln{1 - \frac{1}{v_in}}  \\
v_in = 1
