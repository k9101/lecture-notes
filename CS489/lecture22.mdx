## Population Coding

### Linear Coding

Goal is to find a set of decoding weights $$D \in R^{n+1}$$, such that $$AD \approx X$$.
- Or $$\min_D || AD - X ||^2$$

#### Least Squares

##### Method 1: Normal Equations
- The columns of A have to be linearly independent in order to have a unique solution.
- This method is efficient to compute, but may not be numerically stable.

$$A^T(AD - X) = 0$$
$$A^TAD - A^TX = 0$$
$$A^TAD = A^TX$$: Normal Equations
$$D = (A^TA)^{-1}A^TX = A^+X$$

##### Method 2: SVD
- A more computationally expensive method, but more numerically stable

Let $$U \sigma V^T = A$
- $$U, V^T$$ are orthogonal matricies
- $$\sigma$$: diagonal matrix

$$AD \approx X \implies U \sigma V^T D \approx X$$
$$\sigma V^T D = U^T X$$
$$V^T D = \sigma^{-1} U^T X$$
$$D = V \sigma^{-1} U^T X$$
