## Recurrent Neural Networks

- Recurrent connections, past hidden state is used as input with future time steps with input at current timestep

### Backprop through time
- Loss function defined as the sum through time
- Work back through the hidden layers (through time)
- The at each hidden time step, can compute the inputs at that time step.
