# Lecture 5 - Business Strategy, Diamond E, Comp. Advantage - Sept 26. 2016
## Chapter 2 (up to 38) - Strategy
### The essentials of the Strategy Model
* Each component is a distinct aspect of the strategy.
* Understand of each component, bringing together will give insights of strategy (whether it is consistent or ambiguous).

1. Goals
  * What does the business propose to achieve?
  * What are it's aims (w.r.t growth, profitability, risk)?
2. Product Market Focus
  * What are the products and/or services that business plans to sell, and to what specific markets?
3. Value Proposition
  * How does the business intend to attract customers?
  * What benefits constitute it's offer or value proposition in the marketplace?
4. Core Activities
  * What are the primary value-adding activities that the business intends to perform and how does it intend to perform them?

### The Role of Strategy
* Strategy allows managers to establish, sustain, and monitor the direction of their business.
* The absence of strategy can lead to frustration.
  * Everyone not clear on strategy / no strategy can lead to internal clashes and confusion.
  * Not sure how to prioritize activities / products / services.

1. **A Hub for Analysis**
  * Strategy provides a baseline to organize and discuss understanding of what a business is all about.
  * Starting point for analyzing and debating choices that affect the future direction of the business.
    * Base Case - continue forward with existing strategy.
      * Does it make sense given the future market / competition to do this?
      * What performance can be expected, at what level of risk?
2. **A Link to Action**
  * Strategy provides a vehicle for you to translate general ideas about direction and performance into explicit, actionable terms.
  * **Goals** set up the targets against which progress and performance can be assessed.
  * **Product Market Focus** provides critical direction to people throughout the business so that they can focus their effort on targeted markets and products and avoid wasting their time.
  * **Value Proposition** provides a beacon for employees everywhere, detailing specifically what the business is trying to do for it's customers and the requirements of their particular role.
  * **Core Activities** highlight the key jobs that will have to be done and the capabilities that need most to be developed and reinforced.

### Strategy in a Single Business
* Easier entry points to discover strategy:
  * If a vision or mission exist it is likely that the goals will develop as a natural extension.
  * The value proposition is often easier to articulate when you focus on how value is created in the eyes of the customer.
* Need to ensure that all value components are in alignment.

* **Goals**
  * Are an expression of what a business intends to achieve - absolutely and relative to competition.
  * Contrasts a vision, which may included very long-term goals, strategic goals are more immediate.
  * **Hard Goals**
    * Focus on the aims and performance of the business as a classic economic entity be it for profit or non-profit, revealing measurable targets and time frames.
    * Examples
      * Grow revenues at a rate of 10%.
      * Be the first or second in sales in the market it serves.
      * Hospital focusing on patient safety measures.
  * **Soft Goals**
    * Set targets for the social conduct of the business.
    * Focus on the intentions of the business w.r.t managers, employees, and in the community.
    * Often overlooked because typically analysts only focus on economics.
    * Harder to state in measurable terms (May lead to them being overlooked).
  * **Goal Structures**
    * Goals should represent the important aims of the business (would be true if they reflect the balanced scorecard).
    * Goal structure is the ordering of goals in terms of priority.
    * Types of goal structures
      * **Growth** : Priority on the market, plant and personnel investments to grow the business, potentially at the expense of current profitability.
      * **Harvest**: A stingy approach to investment and spending as priority is given to milking cash and profits from a business.
      * **Divest**: Give priority to actions that prepare and initiate the sale of the business.
    * Can use a goal structure as a competitive advantage. May choose to make greater risks than others in the industry (Boeing).

* **Product Market Focus**
  * Spells out the nature of the products / services that a business intends to offer and the characteristics of the markets that it intends to compete in.
  * Firms can focus on existing products and markets through a **penetration strategy**.
    * Suggests that there is market share to be gained by focusing on the current products and markets.
    * Or perhaps there is growth in the market that would provide for growth even if market share were to remain the same.
  * **Product Development strategy** Develop new products for existing market.
  * **Market Development Strategy** - existing products in new markets.
    * Typically in the case for geographic expansion.
  * Firms may choose to diversify both products and markets.
  * **Product Market Matrix**
    * a visualization of the product market focus.
  * **Product Market Focus and Competitive Advantage**
    * Concentrate on product market niches where competitors are relatively weak or uninterested.

* **Value Proposition**
  * A statement of the fundamental benefit that it has chosen to offer the market.
  * Generic Value Propositions - Michael Porter
    1. **Low Cost**
      * Provide products and services at a lower cost than competitors and enable firms to compete on price.
    2. **Differentiation**
      * Broadly defined to include anything such as service, quality, or features that sets a product of service apart from competitors.
  * Goal to express value propositions in terms of fundamental customer benefits (price, features, service, execution).
  * **Competitive Advantage**
    * Most obvious way in which a business can attempt to differentiate itself from the competition.
    * Costco - low unit price on quantity purchases.
    * Whole Foods - Emphasis on unique product features pesticide-free produce, hormone-free meat, etc.

## Chapter 3 - The Diamond-E Framework
* A high level roadmap for strategic analysis, identifies key variables, and structures the critical relationships among them.
* Strategy is the critical linking variable in the model. Tells what opportunities the business is pursing in the environment and what resources, organizational capabilities and management preferences are required for effective execution.
* Principal logic underlying the framework is **consistency** or **alignment**. High consistency among the variables will lead to successful performance, while conflict or inconsistencies will lead to poor performance.

### Diamond-E Components
* **Strategy <-> Environment**
  * Need to translate environment forces into implications for the bsiness in terms of specific strategic opportunities and challenges.
  * can then check for consistency in strategy.
  * Put together a performance forecast for the proposal under study based on the assumption that it could be successfully implemented.  This assumption will be challenged later in the analysis.
* **Strategy <-> Resources**
  * Identify the resource requirements for the current strategy / new strategic proposal.
  * Compare the required resources with those avaliable to the business and identify resource gaps.
  * Determine the probability of closing resource gaps and the consequences of failing to do so.
  * Learnings can be used to influence future proposals.
    * Emphasizes the non-linearity of the Diamond-E. Continuos feedback loop that incorporates new information.
* **Strategy <-> Management Preferences**
  * Managers are the authors and implement the strategy, thus their preferences will constitute strategic drives and constraints just as resources and organizational capabilities.
  * Start with identification of preferences that are consistent with the execution of the strategy.
  * Compare these preferences to those of the business managers who are critical to execution.
    * If consistent, move on
    * Else -> Problems
      1. May find that management preferences are similar, but at odds with the proposed strategy. Judgement will have to be made on whether preferences can be reasonably modified.
      2. Differences in individual strategic preferences are causing conflicts among the managers as well as with the strategy. **Recall**, prime function of strategy is to get managers to work towards same goals and vision.
* **Strategy <-> Organization**
  * Last step, made it this far and want to determine if the organization an implement it effectively.
  * Identify the organizational capabilities required to implement the strategy.
  * Check consistency between the required capabilities and those evident in the organization.
    * Critical variables that have impact of organization's capabilities
      1. Leadership.
      2. Structure.
      3. Management Processes.
      4. Culture.

## Readings - What is Strategy?
* Positioning is no longer effective, at best, temporary competitive advantage. Rivals can quickly copy any given market position.
* Superior Profitability: delivering greater value allows companies to charge a higher average unit price; greater efficiency allows for a lower average unit price.
* **Operational Effectiveness**: Performing similar activities **better** than rivals can perform them.
* **Strategic Positioning**: performing **different** activities than rivals, or performing similar activities in different ways.
