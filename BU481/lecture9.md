## Management Preferences
* No way to divorce the decisions determining the most sensible economic strategy for a company from the person behind it.
* Intersection between the needs, belief and situational pressures.
* Managment Preferences are specific to their individual personalities, experiences and situations.
### The Roots of Strategic Preference
* **Basic Needs:**
  * Central Aspect of personality.
  * Stable, enduring, fundamental.
* **Beliefs**
  * Can vary from deep to casual and can change over time
  * **Example**: Taste in music.
  * Can shape response to specific strategic initiatives.
* **Job Context**
  * Define the nature of manager's responsibilities, performance assessments, and rewards.
  * Can depend on context.
  * **Job definition**: What you do
  * **Job Relations**: expectations of others on you.
    * Definition vs. relations: unions where they are descripted (can't go outside of bounds)

### Management Preferences
* Whose interests are they acting?
    * Shareholders
    * Employees
    * Customers
    * Challenge: Can't be everything to everyone.

### Management Breaches
* Managers can act in their own best interest, rather than the company's best interest.
* Corporate Governance (Board of Directors)
    * Ensure strategic direction is in the best interest of the company.
    * Ethical breaches may not be so easy to catch (bad judgements)
        * Don't want to be caught (hide things)
        * Groupthink
