## Chapter 4
* **Porter's Five Forces**: Five competitive sources at play that determine an industry's profitability
  * **Competitive Rivalry**
    * The fewer the competitors, the greater likelihood of higher profits.
    * Higher growth industries lower competitive rivalry ("All boats rise with the tide"). Slow / No growth can cause a bitter fight for market share. 
  * **Threat of New Entrants**
    * New entrants who deversify outside of an industry may be able to leverage capibilities and offset costs.
    * Major barriers to Entry:
      1. Economies of Scale
      2. Product Differentiation
      3. Capital Requirements
      4. Cost Disadvantages Independant of Size
      5. Access to Distribution Channels
      6. Government Policy
  * **Suppiler Bargaining Power**
    * If they have higher bargaining power, suppliers can put buyers at the mercy of higher input costs or reduced quality.
    * Likely to be more powerful if:
      * Few suppliers that are more concentrated
      * No other substitute products
      * The product is important to the buyer's business.
      * Supplier's sell to a number of different industries and their product is differentiated.
      * High switching costs to changing suppliers
  * **Buyer Bargaining Power**
    * More Powerful if:
      * Concentrated / Purchase in large volumes
      * They have full information
      * Low switching costs
      * They earn low profits (not much for suppliers to negotiate for)
      * The purchased product represents a significant portion of the buyer's costs (they are more likely to shop around). Especially of the product is standard / undifferentiated.
  * **The Threat of Substitute Products**
    * Products from outside the industry that can provide a similar function / benefit.
    * Can lower the price ceiling within the industry -> lower profits.
    * **Examples**
      * Voip -> Telecommunications
      * Skype -> Business Travel
* **Value Chain**
  * The primary activities selected from the industries value chain (all activities from raw materials to customer). 
  * **Example**
    * A car: gathering raw material, assembly plant, producing tires, disposing of old vehicles
  * Support activities support the value chain.
  * Can be used to lower costs and increase customer's willingness to pay. Support activities to increase margin (i.e. by developing new technology).
  * Companies may choose to outsource parts to instead focus on other areas.
* **Game Theory** - Provide insight into competitive rivalry
  * Generally valid when there are few competitors.
  * **Zero-Sum Game**: One player's gain is exactly equal to the other player's loss.
  * **Tactic Collusion** - because of illegal collusion, competitors attempt to read and interpret eachother's signals to determine motiviation and intent to collaborate. Factors that cause include:
    1. Small number of firms
    2. Homogeneous product, put attention on price which is easy to monitor.
    3. Similar costs allow for a similar price structure and level of output.
    4. Price leaders provide order and discipline to the market.
    5. Industry social structure defines the standards for operating in that industry.
    6. High order frequency and small order size minimizes the cost of loosing an order and incentive to compete.
    7. Large inventories and order backlogs create buffers and reduce pressure to compete.
    8. See **Entry Barriers - Porter's Five Forces**
  * **The Prisonor's Delemma** 
    * Two individual's can work separately to individually maximize their value, which in turn causes both of them to be worse off than when they started.
    * Maximize total value by collaborating.
* **PEST**
  * Macro Forces
    * **Political**
    * **Economic**
    * **Social**
    * **Technological**
  * Micro Forces
    * **Supply**
    * **Competition**
    * **Demand**

## Chapter 5
* Something

## Lecture
* **Industry Definition**
  * Firm / group of firms that produce and / or sell the same or similar products/services to the same market.
  * No definitive rule on where to drawn boundries
    * Avoid being too inclusive or exclusive
  * **Industry Analysis**
    * Understand value
    * understand drivers of profitability
    * attractive
    * macro-economic influence
    * key success factors
  * **Game Theory**
    * Doesn't really work in real life (more than 2 players)
    * Ideal: Cooperate for as long as you can, until you know longer can.
* **Industry Value System** - The entire industry
  * Raw materials -> customer
  * Objective is to add value at each step.
  * usually, firm has minimal controll of activities.
  * Backwards vs. Forward integration.
  * Why? Want to be in control of value
  * **Internal Value Chain** - Activities within local firm scope
* **Porter's Five Forces**
  * All it tells you about is if a particular industry has high profitability.
  * Minimize Rivalry and threat of new is most progitable.
  * **Suppliers**
    * Increased threat if they can forward integrate
  * **Buyers**
    * Think about the impact of one customer (McDonald's customer vs. Apple purchase from supplier)
      * Caveat: this one customer has a large following that can potentially influence other people (social media), but very difficult to do.
    * Think about who is the actual buyer (B2C, B2B).
  * **Industry Analysis**
    * 10% of profits can be explained by industry, 90% the others
* **PEST** 
  * Consider what is going on in the industry right now, and how can changes impact the current state.
    * McDonald's -> Social trends (Super Size Me) can potentially have a large effect.
    * Different than Porter5 which is just a snapshot in time. Can be used together to get a full picture.
  * **Economic** - Think about if this is a recession proof industry
* **Key Success Factors**
  * What do I need to be able to complete in this industry?
  * Need to understand the time horizon.
* Environment / Industry Analysis Examples
  * Ontario Wine Industry - Present Day
    * Governement: Sets up the regulations (who / where / price you can sell etc.) **Huge**. 
    * Suppliers : Bottels, Barrels, Corks 
    * Vinyards
    * Wineries
    * Distributors
    * Wine Brokers / Agents
    * Retailers
      * LCBO - **Has the most power in Ontario**
        * If you want to be a player in Ontario, need a good relationship with them.
      * Wine Rack
      * Grocery Stores
    * **Key Success Factors**
      * Government Permits
      * Quality / Pricing
      * Capital
      * Relationships
      * Need Vines / grapes / climate / geographical constraints
