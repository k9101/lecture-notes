## Class 11 - Strategy - Resources Link

Company resources have 2 roles within the organization:
1. "Fuel": Are required for the business to function
2. Potential sources of strategic competitive advantage.

## Types of Resources

### Tangible
* Marketing (ads)
* Operations (factory)
* R&D Department
* Financial / Human Capital

### Intangible
* Brand
* Reputation

### Organization Capabilities
* Routines
* Processes
* Abilities
* Culture

### Strategic Resources
* Non-tradable assets which are developed from within the firm
* Are valuable to the industry
* Defy imitation because they are socially complex
* Competitive advantage can ultimately be attributed to the ownership of a valuable resource that enables the company to perform activities better or more cheaply than competitors.
* Superior competitive performance will therefore be based on developing a competitively distinct set of resources and deploying them in a well-conceived strategy.

## General Manager: Resources Management

### Key tasks of Manager related to resources
1. Finding / investing in resources
2. Upgrading resources
3. Leveraging Resources

### Resource-Based Strategy
* Companies with competitively valuable resource strengths and competencies often deploy these capabilities to:
  * Boost the competitive power of their overall strategy
  * Bolster their position in the marketplace
* Resource-based strategies
  * Attempt to exploit company resources to offer value to customers in ways rivals cannot match.
  * Can focus on eroding the competitive potency of a rival by developing different resources that effectively substitute for the strengths of the rival.

**Context is important:** A resource that is valuable in one industry may be worthless in a different industry or chronological context.

### Why is Resource-Based View (RBV) Useful
* Gives internal perspective of firm
* Way of explaining why some competitors are more profitable than others
* Suggests how to put idea of core competencies into practices
* Helps develop strategies that make sense depending on what you already have / can get.

### Barney Strategic Resources Test
To be the basis for sustainable competitive advantage, a resource must pass 4 tests:
1. **Value**: Context / Industry dependent
2. **Rarity**: If common resource is at best a necessary entry ticket but not a source of competitive advantage.
3. **Inimitability**: May arise as a result of history, many small decisions, or because of social complexity
4. **Company organized to take advantage of it**: If the organization doesn't exploit the resource there is no value.

**Competitive Parity**: (1) and (2)
**Short-Term Competitive Advantage**: (1) - (3)
**Long-Term Competitive Advantage**: All 4

### When are resources strategically valuable?
* Hard to copy
* It depreciates slowly: i.e. can it sustain over time?
* You company (not employees, suppliers, or customers) control it's value
  * Who is capturing the value created?
* Cannot easily be substituted
* It is better than competitors' similar resources
  * Firms must be honest about this (**Distinctive Competence**)

### What makes a resource hard to copy?
* Physical Uniqueness (material rights, great locations)
* Path dependency: A result of past decisions
* Causal Ambiguity: Unclear what is actually creating that advantage as it is usually a combination of things.
* Economic Deterrence: Usually sizable investment in an asset

## How to do Resource Analysis
1. Develop / Analyze the strategy
2. Identify resource requirements for strategy
3. Test the strategy - resource link
  * What do we have vs. what do we need?
4. Develop gap-closing analysis
  * What do we need to get?
  * How hard will that be?
  * Additional costs
  * Probability of success
  * The cost of failure: What happens if can't implement strategy
5. Move to the next step of diamond-E analysis

### Value Chain Analysis (Internal)
* Determine corporate (shared) resources
* Identify functional areas of company
  * Typically core activities from strategy triangle analysis
  * Usually some combination of company functions
* Link resources to functional areas
* Identify competitive resources / capabilities
* Compare any competitive resource / capability identified to overall strategy

## Class 13 - Strategy Organization Link

### Organization Levers to Support Strategy
1. Organizational Structure
  * Determines how information / influence flow through the hierarchy
  * Always trade-offs
  * Typical structures:
  | Type | Benefits | Issues |
  | :------------- | :------------- | :--- |
  | **Functional** | Standard Product - Efficient | Limited sensitivity to local markets. Slow decision making |
  | **Product** | Focus on each product line | Lose Efficiency. Multiple contact points for customers. |
  | **Geographical** | Good at tailoring to local markets | Lose Efficiencies |
  | **Matrix** | Efficient and Effective | Complex and Slow Moving |
  * **Key**: Align required capabilities based on proposed strategy with organization's structural characteristics.

* **Low Cost Strategy --> Centralized Organizational Process**
  * Commodity products
  * Price competition
  * Org Structure
    * Efficiency
    * Economies of scale and scope
    * Standardizations, volume, repetition of work
    * Lack of duplication of resources
    * Often **Functional**
* **Differentiation Strategy --> Decentralized Organizational Process**
  * Product 1 (high end)
  * Product 2 (High End)
  * Org Structure
    * Two Divisions
    * Self-contained with different resources and capabilities
    * Minimum centralized staff
    * Often product structure

2. Management Processes

      * Assumes humans:
        * Hate work, want to avoid it
        * Prefer to be directed, over having responsibility
        * Striving for security as overarching goal
    * **Theory Y**
      * Putting in work is natural (as playing or resting)
      * Assumes humans:
        * Will direct themselves when they are committed to the Objectives of the organization
        * Satisfaction with a job will result in commitment to the organization
        * People strive for responsibility and personal achievements.
3. Leadership Behaviour
  * Cooperation vs. individual brilliance?
  * Is behaviour consistent with the talk?
  * **Behaviour vs. Culture**

      * How they manage subordinates
    2. Culture --> Shared values beliefs and core basic assumptions
      * Organizational way to think and act
      * Widely shared and strongly felt.
  * **Preventable Risk**: Determined by strategy and industry
    1. Protect your reputation --> Ethical boundaries: The possibility that people engage in behaviours that could damage your company's reputation.
    2. Opportunities to avoid --> Strategic boundaries: The risk that resources will be diverted to opportunities that do not align with your current strategy.
  * **Boundary System**: The acceptable domain of activity for organizational participants
    * How to control **preventable risk**
      1. Can tell people what to do.
      2. Can tell people what not to do.
        * Gives clarity about where the line is.
        * Freedom to act without constant uncertainty
        * Freedom to exercise creativity with defined limits.

### Strategy - Organizational Link Analysis
1. Complete the strategy triangle Analysis
2. Identify the organizational elements (structure, processes, leadership behaviour) required to implement the strategy
3. Determine current organizational elements: Identify gaps
4. Determine how to bridge strategy - organizational gaps and assess feasibility
  * What will it take to do?
  * How much will it cost?
  * How long will it take?
  * How will it impact culture / behaviour
5. Move to the next link in Strategy - Diamond-E

* Organization and Strategy
  1. Organization elements are modified to support the chosen generic strategy and business strategy
  2. Generic strategy and business strategy are chosen to match the organizations characteristics and Environment requirements.

### Globalization
* Feasible strategy does both of:
  * Business/industry environment suggests strategic opportunities (What you would like to do)
  * Company resources and capabilities determine what you are able to do

* **Multi-Domestic Strategy**
  * Companies try to achieve maximum local responsiveness by customizing both their product offering and marketing strategy to match different national conditions.
  * Separate headquarters for each country.
  * Production, marketing, R&D are established in each major national market.
* **Globalization**
  * Presence in multiple markets using the same product presentation and largely similar marketing presence.

* **Caveats of Global Strategies**
  * Admin costs increase: Need to pay for coordination
  * Triggers competitive response
  * Over-Standardization: Some products are not suitable to global
  * Organizational change may be difficult: **The hardest part**

* **Need to Decide**:
  * Which markets to compete in
