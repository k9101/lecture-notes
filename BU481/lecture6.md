  * Low-fare
  * Start with short-haul
  * Offer consumers a lower-cost airline alternative to surface transportation (cars, bus, etc.).
* Lower Costs --> Lower Prices
  * Only one model of aircraft meant lower maintenance and operational costs compared to a fleet of planes.
* Point to Point flights
  * More Cost effective
