## Tesla Case

1. Is the North American electric car industry a profitable industry?
  * Long term: yes 
  * Tesla profitable now
  * Few competitors
  * rapidly growing industry
  * High barriers to entry (capital cost, distribution)
  * Supplier bargaining power - parts sourced from many different suppliers, Tesla has integrated backwards and produces many of their own parts (gigafactory) or gets made custom.
  * Substitute products?
    * Other small electric vehicles (scooters, skateboards, bikes) for short distances
    * Ride sharing services (Uber)
  * Risk of new entrants: higher likelihood from traditional manufacturers rather than new manufacturers.
2. After conducting a PEST analysis, are there any opportunities / red flags for the electric car industry? Are they the same or different as the traditional car industry?
  * Political 
    * Government rebates on electric cars
    * Regulation regarding dealerships 
  * Economic
    * Higher upfront cost of an electric car
    * cheaper over the lifetime (no gas, oil, less maintenance)
  * Social
    * Challenge: Social Adoption
      * range anxiety
    * Be apart of the green movement
    * Uncertainty about the future (ability to charge, resale value)
  * Technological
    * Traditional cars expensive to design and make
    * Can take advantage of more standard parts (electric motors, LI-Ion batteries)
3. What are the key success factors required for the electric car industry? Are they the same or different from the traditional car industry?
  * Electric Cars
    * 
  * Traditional Cars
    * 
4. Is Tesla just limited to a niche or just being a flash in the pan? Is Tesla at a competitive advantage or disadvantage? How will that evolve?
5. What do you think of Tesla's entry strategies to date? What barriers did it have to overcome? 
  * Their strategy: start with high price niche vehicle, use that to fund the next model for more mass market -> repeat. 
  * Initially high capital cost (As a business and for consumers)
  * Social acceptance of electric cars (range anxiety, performance, cool).
  * Limited battery technology 
  * Charging infrustructure
  * Access to distribution channels (dealerships)
