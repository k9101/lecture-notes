## Chapter 4 - Developing a Transnational Organization: Managing Integration, Responsiveness, and Flexibility
- Traditional reasearch and management efforts spent on finding which formal structure provided the right "git" in various conditions

### Stopford and Well's International Structural Stages model
- 2 Variables:
  1. Foriegn sales as a percentage of total sales
  2. Foreign Product Diversity

1. International Division
  - Low in both variables
  - Early stages of foreign expansion, MNE's start with an international division to manage foriegn actions
2. Area Division
  - High foriegn sales, low product diversity
  - Europe, Asia
3. Worldwide Product Division
  - High product diversity, low foriegn sales as a percentage of total sales
4. Global Matrix (Grid)
  - High in both variables
  - Manager in France reports to manager in Europe, who reports to global manager
  - **Failure**: Dual reoprting led to conflict and confusion on many levels

### Building Organizational Capability
Basic problem of a company's search for structral fit was that it focused on only on formal structure.

1. Either-or choice between product-based vs geographically based structure often forced managers to ignore the multiple demands in the external environment
2. The focus on structure led to a defniition of a static set of roles, responsibilities and relationships in a strategic task environment that was dynamic and rapidly evolving.
3. Restructuring efforts often proved harmful as organizations were orten bludgeoned into a major realignment of these roles, responsibilities, and relationships by overnight change in structure.

- MNE Challenge: develop an organization with an appropriate internal network of relationships.
