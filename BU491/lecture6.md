## Chapter 4 - Developing a Transnational Organization: Managing Integration, Responsiveness, and Flexibility
- Traditional reasearch and management efforts spent on finding which formal structure provided the right "git" in various conditions

### Stopford and Well's International Structural Stages model
- 2 Variables:
  1. Foriegn sales as a percentage of total sales
  2. Foreign Product Diversity

1. International Division
  - Low in both variables
  - Early stages of foreign expansion, MNE's start with an international division to manage foriegn actions
2. Area Division
  - High foriegn sales, low product diversity
  - Europe, Asia
3. Worldwide Product Division
  - High product diversity, low foriegn sales as a percentage of total sales
4. Global Matrix (Grid)
  - High in both variables
  - Manager in France reports to manager in Europe, who reports to global manager
  - **Failure**: Dual reoprting led to conflict and confusion on many levels

### Building Organizational Capability
Basic problem of a company's search for structral fit was that it focused on only on formal structure.

1. Either-or choice between product-based vs geographically based structure often forced managers to ignore the multiple demands in the external environment
2. The focus on structure led to a defniition of a static set of roles, responsibilities and relationships in a strategic task environment that was dynamic and rapidly evolving.
3. Restructuring efforts often proved harmful as organizations were orten bludgeoned into a major realignment of these roles, responsibilities, and relationships by overnight change in structure.

- MNE Challenge: develop an organization with an appropriate internal network of relationships.

## Midterm
- 4 to 5 SA questions
- Listing items in models
- Adv, disadv
- Any materials fair game
- Up to the end of today
- no cases

## Lecture
- Use 7 C's models to decide on which of the 3 A's is right for your firm.

> Success in management requires learning as fast as the world is changing
- There is no individual individual / element that you can learn from
- Importance of teamwork

### Matrix structure fails
- Too many captains, not enough sailors
- Imbalance of information
- Inefficient
- What do you do?
- Who do you listen to?

### Administrative Heiritage
- How did the firm go about adopting the current structure
- Look at past history, experience, and changes

### Different Structure
1. Decentralized Federation
  - Multinational approach
  - respond to local needs
2. Coordinated Federation
  - Large home markets serve as a knowledge source
  - tweak and change / implement in other markets
  - Economies of scale with changes
  - Transfer of expertice and knowledge
  - **Con**: Potentially too much reliance on home
3. Centralized Hub
  - Economies of scale, aggregation approach
  - Mobility of production
  - Value chain accross multiple markets

### Building the Transnational organization
Use the following items as a checklist

**Integrated Network**
1. Build multiimensional internal perspectives
  - Insights can come from various locals
  - Prioritization of tasks
  - Intrinsic or Extrinsic rewards to get people to do these things
2. Build dispersed and interdepentent physical assets and capabilities
  - Teamwork
  - Trust
  - Must come up with org. structures that allow for distributed network where everyone has a role
3. Build flexibile integrative processes
  - Adaptability to changes in organizational structure (change lead countries for a certain product line)

- No longer a person at the top of the business
- May have people at the center.

- A structural anatomy of the transnational firms require an approach to reporting structure, roles and responsibilities
  - A new process based physiology where systems and decisions flow must be assessed
    - Respond quickly to market needs, resouces, and avaliability
  - New cultural psychology
    - Shared values between everyone
    - Has a sence of roles
    - must quickly adapt to new realities
