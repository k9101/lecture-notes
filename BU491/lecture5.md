## Chapter 3: Developing Transnational Strategies

### Conflicting Viewpoints
1. Theodore Levitt: global strategy is the successful practice of product standardization.
  - Develop standard products to be sold and manufactured the same way around the world.
2. Michael Porter: know many tricks
  - exploit economies of scale through global volume
  - take preemptive positions through quick and large invetments
  - manage interdependantly to achieve synergies across different activities
3. Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad: Broad product portfolio
  - many product varieties
  - Share investments in technologies and distribution channels across product lines
  - Cross-subsidize products across markets
  - develop a strong woldwide distribution system

### Worldwide Competitive Adantage
- Competitive advantage is developed by taking strategic actions that optimize a company's achievement of these different strategies.

1. Leverage scale economies that are available in it's different woldwide activities.
2. Exploit differences in soucing and market opportunities amoung the counties in which it operates
3. Capitalize on the diversity o it's activities and operations to create synergies / develop economies of scope.

MNE's strategic challenge: exploit all 3 sources of globl competitive advantage to optimize global efficiencies, multinationalflexibility, and worldwide learnings

### The Goals

**Global Efficiency**
- Overall efficiency of an MNE as the ratio of the value of it's outputs to the value of it's inputs.
- Efficiency could be enhanced by increasing the value of outputs
  - higher revenues
- Lowering the value of inputs
  - lowering costs
- Or do both

- **Global Integration-National Responsiveness Framework**
  - y-axis: Efficiency benefits from global integration
  - x-axis: Differentiation benefits from national responsiveness

**Multinational Flexibility**
The ability of a company to manage the risks and exploit the opportunities that arise from the diversity and volatility of the global environment.
Requires the MNDto scan it's broad environment to detect changes and discontinuities and then respond to the new situation in the context of the worldwide business.

- MNE's faces an operating environment characterized by diversity and volitility
- Some opportunities and risks geneerated by the environment are experienced by all firms
- Some are unique

- **Important Skills**
  - Adaptability
  - People who know the political landscapes
  - Resources

- **Sources of Diversity and volatility**
  - Common thread across all risks: they vary across countries and change over time.
  1. Macroeconomic Risks: Completely outside of the control of the MNE
    - Changing prices
    - Factor costs
    - Exchange rates (caused by war, natural disasters, economic cycles)
  2. Political risks that arise from policy action of national government
    - managed changes in exchange rates
    - interest rate adjustments
  3. Competitive risks: from the uncertainties of competitor's responses to the MNE's own strategies
  4. Resource Risks
    - Avaliability of raw materials, capital, or managerial talent

**Worldwide Learning**
- Key asset to MNE: Diversity in the environment in which it operates
- Exposes the MNE to multiple stimulti, causing it to develop diverse capabilities
- Can learn the key success factors for a particular market
  - Figure out what your missing
  - Use it to prioritize and inform decisions


### The Means

**National Differences**
- Different nationals have different factors -> Differences in factor costs
  - abundance of land
  - excess materials
  - lots of labour
- Different business functions use different factors to various degrees
  - **Example:** GE Global Product Concept: concentrate manufacturing whereever it could be implemented in the most cost-effective way (while still maintaining quality)
- Global situations are rarely stable over time
- MNE strategy must be flexible and responsive to changing differences in home and host-country environments

- Market potential varies across countries

| | Local | Global |
|-|-------|--------|
| High | Shape or localize | Create a platform |
| Low | Reinvent business model | Target niche |

**Scale Economies**
- Scale as cost reduction
- scale as a competitive tool
- Dynamic benefits of scale
  - experience or learning effect
  - high volume that helps a firm exploit scale benefits allow it to accumulate learnings -> cost reductions

**Scope Economies**
- certain economies arise from the fact that the cost of the joint production (dev / dist) of two+ products can be less than the cost of producing them separately.
- Gives the firm the ability to share investments and costs across value chains
- Product market focus

### International, Multinational, Global, and Transnational Strategies
Cases will Typically give an org structure, use this to identify strategy:

**International Strategy**
- Approach focus on creating and exploiting innovations on a worldwide basis, using all the different means to achieve this end.
- Many suffered from deficiencies of efficiency and flexibility, they did not develop either yje centralized and high scalw, or the very high degree of local responsiveness

**Multinational Strategies**
- Concentrates primarily on one means (national differences) to achieve most of it's strategic objectives.
- Tend to focus on the revenue side, usually by differentiating their products and services in response to national differences in customer preferences, industry characteristics, and government regulations.
- Depend on local-for-local innovations
  - Subsidiary must identi local needs and use local resources to respond to those needs.
  - Autonomy amoungst subidiaries

**Global Strategy**
- Depend primarily on developing global efficiency

**Transnational Strategy**
- Assumptions in tranditional strategies: The global company assumes that the best cost position is the key source of competitiveness. The Multinational company sees differentiation as the primary way to enhance performance and the international company expects to use innovations to reduce costs and enhance revenues.
- Costs and revenues must both be managed

### Strategic Tasks
**Defending Worldwide Dominance**
- Must master all of: {global efficiency, multinational flexibility, and worldwide learning} at the same time
- As a large company, Afraid of the little company that can move master than you can.
  - But a large company can afford to take more risks.

**Challenging the Global Leader**

**Protecting Domestic Niches**
- Protect niche from worldwide players with superior resources and multiple sources of competitive advantage.

1. Defend against the competitor's global advantage
2. Offset the competitor's global advantage
3. Form an alliance with a viable global company.

## AAA Triangle
**What the tools does**
- Compare yourself to industry averages, competitors
- Find where you fit
- Get ideas on where to do things differently

**Adaption**
- Advertising to Sales ratio
- Boost revenes and market share by maximizing a firm's local relevance.
**Aggregation**
- R&D to Sales ratio
- Deliver economies of scale by creating regional / global operations
- involves standardizing products, grouping the development and production process
**Arbitrage**
- Labour to Sales ratio
- exploitation of differneces between national or regional markets, often by locating separate parts of the supply chain in diferent places.

### Why Transformation Efforts Fail
1. Not establishing a great enough sense of urgency
2. not creating a powerful enough guiding coalition
3. lacking a vision
4. Undercommunicating the vision by a factor of ten
5. Not removing obstacles to the new vision
6. Not systematically planning for, and creating, short-term wins
7. Declaring Victory too soon
8. Not anchoring changes in the corporation's culture

### 7 C's
- Relate 7 C's (See the Managing Differences article) in terms of the A Triangle
- **How to use**:
  - Look at each A, compare and contrast in each country

1. Competitive Advantage
2. Configuration
3. Coordination
4. Control
5. Change Blockers
6. Corporate Diplonacy
7. Corporate Strategy
