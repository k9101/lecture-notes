### Alliance vs. Portfolio Alliance
- Alliance
  - Looking at each alliance on an individual basis.
- Portfolio
  - What alliances does our company already have
  - How will a new alliance effect the existing
  - ex. A company with a Coke partnership tries to partner with Pepsi, could annoy Coke.

- Need to weigh the benefit vs. cost in both an individual and portfolio perspective.
- i.e. if individual benefit outweights the negative effects on the overall portfolio, it would make sense to perform the alliance.

- Need a Manager of Alliances
  - Someone who oversees all of the alliances
  - Looks at the cost / benefit over the entire company.
