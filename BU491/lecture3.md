## Chapter 2 - Understanding the International Context
- Theodore Levitt believes that tech, social, and economic trends are converging towards a unified marketplace.
  - Critics argued that he fails to see the limitations of globalization

### Forces for Global Integration and Coordination

Principal Economic forces that drove the structural transformation of businesses:
1. Economies of Scale
  - Industrial Revolution
  - Combined intermediate processes into single plants and developed large-batch / continuous process technologies to achieve low-cost volume production.
  - Eventually production at scale exceeded the demand in the local market, forcing international market expansion.
2. Economies of Scope
  - Less capitally intensive industries, benefitted from the ease of communication and transportation
  - Trading companies: Export the products of many companies, achieve a greater volume than any single company could, lowering cost.
3. Differences in the availiability and cost of productive resources
  - **Factor Costs**
  - Due to changes in technology and access to global markets
  - European petrol companies explored the Middle East because of Europe's limited domestic crude oil supplies
  - Turning to international markets as a source of cheap labour
  - Liberalization of world trade agreements
    - **General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT)**
    - Creation of **EU**
    - **NAFTA**
    - World Trade Organization (WTO)
    - Reduced barriers to international trade

**Example for both scope and scale**
Panasonic: took advantage
- scale advantages from highly specialized plants
- scope advantages through marketing and sales networks, repair services for a wide variety of products

### Global Competitors as Change Agents
- Many industries were driven to beome more globally integrated primarily through external forces of change.
- Industries that weren't due to external, saw a benefit that could be obtain by becoming globally integrated.

**Cross-Subsidization of Markets / Global Chess**
- The funds generated in one market could be used to subsidize it's position in another
- Can use high profit markets to subsidize lower-profit markets, but maintain global position

### Cultural Differences
1. Power Distance: Social distance between weak and powerful members of society
2. Uncertainty Avoidance:
3. Individualism
4. Masculinity

### Government Demands
1. Unrestricted access to resources and markets throughout the world
2. The freedom to integrate manufacturing and other operations across national boundaries
3. unimpleded right to coordinate and control all aspects of the company on a worldwide basis.\

### Global, Multinational, International Industries
**Global Industries**
- Economic forces of globalization are dominant
- Success => Adopt global strategies
  - Capitalizing on highly centralized
  - scale-intensive manufacturing and R&D operations
  - Leveraging them through worldwide exports of standardized global products
- View the global market as one market

**Multinational Industries**
- worldwide businesses in which the dominance of national differences in cultrual, social, and political environments allow multiple national industry structures to flourish.
- Don't know how to achieve full global integration and responsiveness
- Successful => Follow multinational strategies
  - building strong and resourceful national subsidiaries that are sensitive to local market needs
  - Allow subsidiaries to manage their local businesses by developing or adapting products and strategies to respond to the powerful localizing forces

**International Industries**
- Technological forces are central, and the need for companies to develop and diffuse innovations is the dominant souce of competitive advantage
- Success => Ability to innovate and appropriate the benefits of those innovations in multiple national markets that differentiates the winners from the losers
- International Strategy
  - The ability to manage te creation of new products and processes in one's home market effectively and diffuse those innovations to foreign affiliates sequentially.

### Transition to Transnationality
- Dominance of single set of environmental forces, replaced by complex set of forces
  - example: new economies of scale / scope, intensifying competition
- Companies have begun to emphasize the local design and production of differentiated product ranges in different countries, for different segments

**Transnational Industry**
- simultaneous demands for global efficiency, national responsiveness, and worldwide innovations
- Very difficult to defend a competitive position on the basis of only one dominant capability
- Must respond to all forces at the same time
- efficiency
