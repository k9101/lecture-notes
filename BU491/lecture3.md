## Chapter 2 - Understanding the International Context

  - Critics argued that he fails to see the limitations of globalization

### Forces for Global Integration and Coordination

Principal Economic forces that drove the structural transformation of businesses:
1. Economies of Scale
  - Industrial Revolution
  - Combined intermediate processes into single plants and developed large-batch / continuous process technologies to achieve low-cost volume production.
  - Eventually production at scale exceeded the demand in the local market, forcing international market expansion.
2. Economies of Scope
  - Less capitally intensive industries, benefitted from the ease of communication and transportation
  - Trading companies: Export the products of many companies, achieve a greater volume than any single company could, lowering cost.
3. Differences in the availiability and cost of productive resources
  - **Factor Costs**
  - Due to changes in technology and access to global markets
  - European petrol companies explored the Middle East because of Europe's limited domestic crude oil supplies
  - Turning to international markets as a source of cheap labour
  - Liberalization of world trade agreements
    - **General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT)**
    - Creation of **EU**
    - **NAFTA**
    - World Trade Organization (WTO)
    - Reduced barriers to international trade

**Example for both scope and scale**
Panasonic: took advantage
- scale advantages from highly specialized plants
- scope advantages through marketing and sales networks, repair services for a wide variety of products
