## Chapter 1: Expanding Abroad: Motivations, means, and mentalities
- Worldwide operations give companies access to new markets and low-cost resources.
- Increased knowledge, more options for strategic moves

### MNE == Multi-National Enterprise
Qualifications:
1. Must have substantial direct investment in foreign countries, not just trading relationships
2. Engaged in the active management of offshore assets rather than simply holding them in a passive investment portfolio.

The definition has changed over the years:
- Need strategic and operational integration, active coordination of management across countries.
- MNE creates an internal organization to carry out key cross-border tasks and transactions internally, rather than depending on trade through the external markets.

### MNE Influence in the Global Economy
- Not all MNE's are large, but most large companies are MNE's
- Large MNE's have considerable influence on a global scale
- Have the largest strategic and organizational challenges for managers

### Motivations

Traditional
1. The need to secure key supplies
2. market seeking behaviour. Exploit competitive advantages in offshore markets (brand, tech)
  - Take advantage of economies of scale and scope
  - Insufficient local market
3. Access low-cost factors of production / cost-differences

The starting point for internalization is typically an innovation that a company creates in it's home country. Grows to function entierly in it's home country.
Begins to export to other countries. Eventually there a benefit to establish themselves in countries served by exports.

**Emerging Motivations**
1. Increasing scale economies, increased R&D investment, shorter product lifecycles
2. Global scanning and learning capabilities.
  - May help located more efficient resources, better employees
  - Enhance current advantage
3. Advantages of competitive positioning
  - Become better at entering new markets
  - global information access

**Prerequisites for Internationalization**
- Domestic companies have a huge advantage over foreign companies (know market, customers)
  - Foreign company must counter act with unique strategic capabilities.
  - MNE needs superior knowledge and skills to succeed in foriegn markets
- Must have the capability to leverage it's strategic assets through subsidiaries, rather than contracts

1. There must be foreign countries that offer certain location-specifi advantages to provide the motiviation for the company to invest there.
2. The company must have some competitive advantage to counteract the unfamiliarity of foreign markets.
3. It must possess some organizational capabilities to achieve better returns from leveraging its strategic strenghts internally.

**The process of internalization**
Foreign-market entry is a learning process.
- The company makes an initial commitment of resources to the foreign market
- Gains local market knowledge through about customers, competitors and regulatory conditions.
- The company gradually builds neccessary local capabilities and market knowledge to become an effective competitor in the foreign country.

- Online companies are easier to be "Born Global" - fewer barriers on the internet

**International -> Transnational**

International
- Manager's initially think of foreign subsidiaries as distant outposts, whose main goal is to support the home operations.
- Products are developed for the home market, then later sold internationally
- Prefer to enter markets with low "psychic distance" between it and the home market

Multinational
- Managers begin to recognize and emphasize the differences amoung national markets and operating environments.
- More flexible, modify products to suit different markets
- Raises inefficient manufacturing infrastructure in the company, plants built to local markets

Global
- Think in terms of creating products for the world market
- Manufacture in a few highly efficient plants
- Requires significantly more central coordination and control

Transnational
- Customers reject homogenous products
- Governments begin to request investment in their countries

## The Tortuous Evolution of the Multinational Corporation
- Company A: key posts are held by home-country nationals. hire from within the home country
- Company B: The affiliate's managing director is of the local nationality.
- Company C: Each domestic branch operates independantly
- Company D: Embraces their non-american culture.

### Primary attitudes amoung international executives towards building a multinational enterprise
### EPG Profiles

1. ethnocentric (home-country oriented)
  - Typically complex in home country, simple operations in foriegn
  - Decisions based in home country headquarters
  - Home standards are applied everywhere

2. Polycentric (host-country oriented)
  - loosely connected group with independent subsidiaries
  - standards are determined locally

3. geocentric (world oriented)
  - Increasingly complex and interdependent
  - develop the best people everywhere in the world for key positions

## When you shouldn't go global

### Test
1. Are there potential benefits for out company?
  - The race to globalize sometimes leads people to overestimate the size of the prize.
2. Do we have the necessary management skills?
  - Even if benefits do exist for your company, you may not be positioned to take advantage of them.
3. Will the costs outweigh the benefits?
  - Increased overhead from going international may outweigh the potential reward.
